Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,"I bought a Syska smart IoT light bulb last week which works on Bluetooth Low energy. It connects with a phone app and you can change color over Bluetooth using it.. it was fun for 1-2 days but it scratched that part of my brain which forced me to know how😂 so this is a great example of why IoT is not safe. With Android kit kat you can sniff Bluetooth packets which I did and try to analysed the GATT profile using wireshark, then I found that service which was responsible for changing color and I found the string , it was like
A UUID<RRGGbb>Another fixed number stream. 

RRGGBB is 3x 8bit number which controls intensity of Red Blue and Green color using which you can produce any color. Once I found address to that GATT it was just matter of replicating this string using your own application. I use a Rpi with BLE chip and Bluez stack to send data on that address and I can control tht bulb. I've previously studied BLE protocol in detail n know that vendors can have custom profiles n UUID , bit Syska seems like using a example from chip manufacturer and unencrypted communication making it easy to hack! Its a small thing having a control of someones else bulb but IoT device manufacturers are so keen to bring product to market that they don't care about security and this is what's not good thing about it....",1501612204

Sanchit,,inovizz,"Hi Guys, There is a regional Python Conference happening in Hyderabad named as ""PyConf Hyderabad"". This is an effort to bring synergies around Python together under one roof. 

We'd be delighted to have your presence at this conference to hear from the Python Gurus/Professionals and also to learn from their experience. Please check out more details at - http://pyconf.hydpy.org/

If any of your friend is from Hyderabad, India then please do spread the word. Thanks!",1504415109
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,"I was thinking maybe we should have some particuar guideline for poster making. The size, the font, things that need to be taken care of so that not everytime we have to get volunteers revise the posters for same issues. Thoughts?",1504421183
.,,rajudev,"A specific team made which consists people who can design posters. And designing is actually the easy part, understanding the Crux of 'what' you are designing and 'why' is the most important part. 
That way the team can have a set of posters ready for upcoming meetups.",1504421809
Priyal,Trivedi,priyal_trivedi,Yes. Because the process has become very iterative.,1504421810
Priyal,Trivedi,priyal_trivedi,I think that would in some sense defeat the purpose of volunteering.,1504421927
.,,rajudev,You got a point there.,1504422004
.,,rajudev,But a new volunteer can always join the team.,1504422027
.,,rajudev,"We should decide the balance between making the group work in an efficient manner, and letting people get opportunities to contribute to the group.",1504422175
Priyal,Trivedi,priyal_trivedi,Forming separate groups for specific tasks would not help newbies to get over the apprehension for volunteering for tasks.,1504422223
Priyal,Trivedi,priyal_trivedi,"IMHO, let's find some other method .. rather than forming group inside groups.",1504422270
.,,rajudev,Agreed..,1504422910
.,,rajudev,"I guess, the other approach can be to function as we are right now. The current designers will eventually learn when they keep designing posters one after another",1504423014
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,I like this idea,1504423070
Priyal,Trivedi,priyal_trivedi,"I suggest, Can't we have a template?",1504423264
Priyal,Trivedi,priyal_trivedi,Because the content remains the same.,1504423275
Priyal,Trivedi,priyal_trivedi,"Define font size for the heading,  Content",1504423304
Priyal,Trivedi,priyal_trivedi,Other things could be adjusted when we alter according to the design.,1504423337
Priyal,Trivedi,priyal_trivedi,@Reflect0r for eg. You could upload the raw file of your design so that it'll be easier for the next meetup when somebody else takes up the task to make posters.,1504423430

"" ANDROBOTS ""
An amazing platform where you get to design your own bots & contribute towards automating as many mundane tasks as possible. 

- The participants have to design their own bots at the venue and present their bots. 

For the backend of the bot you could use an API(such as api.ai) or code it using Python,node js etc & for front end you can either use a messaging platform (like Telegram, SLACK)or you can build an android app etc.  

It could be anything from a sensor bot, customer support chat bots, a fun Emojify bot, horoscope bot & what not! 

Think out ot the box, Showcase your coding skills & come out with an 'extraordinary product'.

Innovation is the key ! 

So stop thinking...& start building !

Join us on 24th Oct 2017 and let's tread on together in this techie ride of bots!

On 12th Dec - Tuesday, Dream11 - the cricket fantasy league company is organizing a special online hiring event on CutShort, an AI recruitment platform.


They will have a live webcast with the actual tech team that built a platform for massive scale (1M requests/min). You can connect and interact with them. If you're open to new jobs, this event offers the fastest and easiest way to get hired. Register here: https://goo.gl/JiRws2


The Dream11 Code Challenge

Dream11 is looking for bright folks across tech, design, data science, product management and so on.


But for developers, Dream11 has floated a tech challenge. Unlike a typical hackathon, this challenge is much more practical and shorter. It's a 90 min test that if solved will get you a fast tracked hiring process and a certificate of accomplishment from CutShort.


Why work at Dream11?

Dream11 is India’s leading fantasy sports platform with a growing user base of over 15 million+ Indians playing fantasy cricket, football, kabaddi & basketball. Dream11 is a series C funded startup with marquee investors like Multiple Equity, Kalaari Capital and the US based hedge fund -Think Investments.

Mrigank,,mrigank10,Error while installing kali resolved it by reinserting the usb,1513362852
Mrigank,,mrigank10,Should i choose guided lvm or guided entire disk,1513362872
T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,Whichever suits you.,1513362932
Ashish,Bishnoi,Ashishbishnoi,LVM is better although,1513362964
Ashish,Bishnoi,Ashishbishnoi,It has many advantages,1513363005
Mrigank,,mrigank10,Can you please tell me the difference i searched the veb although but could not understand it fully,1513363006
T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,Then you should not choose LVM. first time installation I presume,1513363030
Mrigank,,mrigank10,Yes 2nd time just to understand,1513363061
Mrigank,,mrigank10,🙈,1513363064
Ashish,Bishnoi,Ashishbishnoi,1.You can resize partions in lvm without unmounting while in traditional method you need to unmount.,1513363076

Ashish,Bishnoi,Ashishbishnoi,What??,1513363475
Mrigank,,mrigank10,The advantage of lvm is flexibility it provides in partition of drives,1513363515
Ashish,Bishnoi,Ashishbishnoi,"Yeah.
For example you need to shrink or expand your root partition then you need to unmount it which is not possible while using it.",1513363575

Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,"Well. The situation even persists in colleges when its actually the career making time. Most indian parents still wish their kids to get good grades.

Mrigank,,mrigank10,Where can i gind what the error is about?,1514909932
Mrigank,,mrigank10,Find*,1514909940
T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,Internet.,1514909966
T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,I just told you btw.,1514909981
Mrigank,,mrigank10,I searched the web but I couldn’t find anything bout it,1514909993
Mrigank,,mrigank10,I know but i want to know how you know it and i dont 😂😂😅😅,1514910015
Mrigank,,mrigank10,Thank you btw 😁😁😁😁,1514910023
Mrigank,,mrigank10,And how can io error be realted to permission of user,1514910056
T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,"Everything in Unix is a file, so reading and writing happens for almost everything. So certain user may not have permission to read or write file like guest, but root user will have.",1514910178
T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,"In case of the error, it's a python program. So you can check for IOERROR exception in the docs.",1514910218
Mrigank,,mrigank10,Okay so if i open terminal through root user then this wont happen?,1514910230
T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,Yup,1514910236
T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,Or you can do sudo,1514910244

Mrigank,,mrigank10,Okayy wait it worked now😅,1514910357
Mrigank,,mrigank10,I tried sudo only for opening torghost,1514910373
Mrigank,,mrigank10,Not for starting it,1514910379
Mrigank,,mrigank10,And one more question why cant i use torghost command after typing sudo su command?,1514910478
T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,Are you typing commands blindly?,1514910511
Mrigank,,mrigank10,No,1514910521
Mrigank,,mrigank10,I thought that if i start torghost through sudo then everything will have root permission,1514910553
T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,"Ok, just never ever do : sudo rm  -rf /
It will blow up your system or whatever.",1514910586

T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,You should be able to,1514910648

Mrigank,,mrigank10,Okayy i get it now,1514910780

T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,What's the last line?,1514910975

Now there is some gradle sync issues..",1515517816
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Well. @reflect0r can help you. I just used it for 2 days :P,1515517834

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Send some details so that @Reflect0r can help,1515522461
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,,1515523397
.,,rajudev,I solved all these issues a week back,1515523915
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,"Specified gradle path in settings then there is an error 
""Failed to find target with hash string""",1515523931
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,How..?,1515523938
.,,rajudev,Shreeyanshi go to your home directory,1515523951
.,,rajudev,There is a directory named Android,1515523971
.,,rajudev,Get into it,1515523980
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,OK..then,1515523989
.,,rajudev,ls and send a pic,1515523994
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,,1515524045
.,,rajudev,"Okay, inside android directory there is sdk",1515524052
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,Yes,1515524071
.,,rajudev,And inside sdk there are all the tools which are required by Android Studio to function,1515524082
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,Tools or build-tools or platform-toolss..?,1515524130
.,,rajudev,Right? So I am making you understand the problem.,1515524136
.,,rajudev,Let's solve this here,1515524144
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,How,1515524157
.,,rajudev,,1515524195
.,,rajudev,so each of these directories have different executable files.,1515524221
.,,rajudev,in platform-tools tools build-tools etc.,1515524254
.,,rajudev,check the contents of those folders,1515524293
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,for which file.?,1515524324
.,,rajudev,"We need to make our system, especially the terminal to be able to find these executable files. Let me send an image",1515524400
.,,rajudev,,1515524414
.,,rajudev,"you can see the files in bold green names, those are the executables",1515524466
.,,rajudev,"things like fastboot ,`emulator` etc runs from there",1515524493
.,,rajudev,lets solve the issue here.,1515524508
.,,rajudev,go to your home folder,1515524514
.,,rajudev,there is a file named .bashrc,1515524528
.,,rajudev,If you can't see the file then enable Show hidden files option from the menu,1515524562
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,Got the file,1515524577
.,,rajudev,open that file with any text editor,1515524600
cocoa,,cocoa1231,@rajudev you don't need to export variables in order for android studio to be able to build. You need the ANDROID_SDK variable if you are using something like cordova or kivy. Android studio downloads everything. Including gradle (as far as I know),1515524613
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,Gradle is already installed...still there is an error,1515524677
.,,rajudev,"how I solved it was using gradle from the repos, and for every other functionality point the system to these folders to get the executables.",1515524715
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Okay, let's try that",1515524831
.,,rajudev,@cocoa1231 can you suggest a better way?,1515524841
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Um. Maybe she just needs to check the SDK manager if everything is downloaded?,1515524863
.,,rajudev,lets focus on making it work for her. We can discuss on the optimal approach later. right?,1515524873
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Sure,1515524889
.,,rajudev,Shreeyanshi opened the file?,1515524929
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,yes,1515524937
.,,rajudev,"go to the very last line, and show us what's written there.",1515524961

Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,Is this OK,1515525636
.,,rajudev,seems so,1515525663
.,,rajudev,now about the gradle part.,1515525679
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,I should save this,1515525708
.,,rajudev,yes,1515525719
.,,rajudev,after saving close all terminals,1515525761
.,,rajudev,and open a new terminal,1515525766
.,,rajudev,we'll need to do check one more thing for the gradle thing,1515525787
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,what,1515525824
.,,rajudev,"just to make sure, send us the output of apt show gradle",1515525890

Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,Ctrl v is not working there,1515526152
.,,rajudev,actually Ctrl + C didn't worked,1515526178

.,,rajudev,those are the ones provided by installer.,1515526789
.,,rajudev,are they present somewhere in the installed location? under the Android folder under home,1515526822
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,No,1515526833
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,In android-studio under home,1515526850
.,,rajudev,that is where you extracted the installer folder. It is not the installed location of Android Studio,1515526888
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"As far as I can understand from this, Android studio tried to download from the server but got a 502 error, so something went wrong from the server side. So those directories must be partial downloads of gradle. The ones that Android Studio failed to download",1515526918
.,,rajudev,I might be a little wrong here,1515526929
.,,rajudev,Shreeyanshi just try one thing. Close all instances of Android Studio,1515526959
.,,rajudev,and all terminals as well,1515526975
.,,rajudev,and now start Android Studio again.,1515526987
.,,rajudev,the bashrc should do the magic here,1515526998
.,,rajudev,you are right there about the files. Not sure of the partial dowload thing though,1515527091
.,,rajudev,Shreeyanshi try building your project again.. Is it happening successfully now?,1515527128
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,Same msg..,1515527135
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,Failed to find target with hash string.....,1515527158
.,,rajudev,okay now do sudo apt install gradle in a terminal,1515527166
.,,rajudev,and let the process complete,1515527173
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"If it asks to continue, do it",1515527199
.,,rajudev,charger of rajudev's laptop is broken,1515527399
cocoa,,cocoa1231,XD,1515527424
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Just have to install gradle and then restart android studio to see if it finds it, right?",1515527439
.,,rajudev,yes. Getting back from phone,1515527468
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,its installing...,1515527475
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Okay cool. Let us know when it's done,1515527525
cocoa,,cocoa1231,https://www.reddit.com/r/TempleOS_Official/comments/7nxgjb/temple_os_isnt_affected_by_recent_intel_exploit/ hehe,1515527579
.,,rajudev,"Back from phone, no more screenshots from my side for a while",1515527689
.,,rajudev,Here is the use case @cocoa1231,1515527709
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Okay. Just for the record. You have not stopped typing for 5 minutes,1515528075
cocoa,,cocoa1231,XD,1515528084
.,,rajudev,"chsh will change the default login shell for me. That is actually great If I have to use fish at all times. 

But there are times when I need to not use fish. 
- If I am using a command which I do not want fish to know and predict. fish is very fishy, and it looks over everything you type

- things like Ctrl + r which are classic commands to use previously used commands. Sometimes I would want to use it.

- A pentester would not like there history to be stored in atleast fish shells. 

If any of those use cases occur, I can simply press Ctrl +  d and I am back to my regular shell. While in the case if I would have changed my default shell to fish,  I would not have been able to it. Any shell I opened would be fish. The bashrc approach gives me the option to switch any moment at ease.",1515528183
.,,rajudev,"I am not a pentester, but that use case is valid",1515528226
.,,rajudev,Typing on phone's is sometimes cumbersome,1515528281
.,,rajudev,"I use Ctrl + d a lot to close terminals, instead of closing the window it is in",1515528327
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,Its fixed...,1515528352
.,,rajudev,I really didn't stop for anything,1515528354
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,Thanks..,1515528360
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Hm. Okay. Two things. Firstly, I don't know about fish, but ctrl+r works in zsh. And all your commands are logged anyway in your .<shell>_history. fish or any other shell which has autocomplete just filters from there. And secondly you can just type bash when you want to change to bash. But I guess ctrl+d is more convenient",1515528366
.,,rajudev,👏,1515528374
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yeah. I just thought that it'd be funny for anyone reading it in the future,1515528406
.,,rajudev,"I guess, Ctrl + d is more of an habbit. As I have to login to many remote machines at times, and Ctrl + d is the thing I do there to close that particular session",1515528470
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,Please suggest me from where should I start learning android as a beginner,1515528476
.,,rajudev,I can give some advice for sure. But some of that is an area of @Reflect0r,1515528542
.,,rajudev,Regarding the history part,1515528563
cocoa,,cocoa1231,This was the reason I was suggesting chsh. Kinda inefficient,1515528659
.,,rajudev,"I am aware that history is indeed being recorded. 
It is just that with regular shells, for previously used commands. I have to search and get the complete command to use. 


While with fish, the thing is that, the moment I start entering a command similar to that, it will predict the whole command from the history for me, not necessary in some of the use cases.",1515528718
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yeah, zsh does that too. What I was saying was that not using fish for pentesters because of that history thing would be redundent, right?",1515528781
.,,rajudev,Are you learning Java?,1515528791
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,I have just done an introductory course for java,1515528864
.,,rajudev,"Sometimes yes, when they are sending ping bombs over an address . 

Sometimes it might help remember the lengthy commands they actually need to use.",1515528866
.,,rajudev,Have you learned HTML/CSS/JS ?,1515528890
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,Just HTML CSS not js,1515528990
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Python?,1515529000
.,,rajudev,"@cocoa1231 now about the android problem that we helped solved here. 
There was actually a shorter solution to it. We in fact solved a problem that she would actually encounter later.",1515529018
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,No,1515529018
.,,rajudev,No,1515529032
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,No,1515529048

Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,How...,1515529120
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,Are you suggesting hybrid,1515529136
.,,rajudev,Shreeyanshi Do you like Java?,1515529143
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,Actually I havnt coded much using java,1515529178
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,So I can't say anything,1515529192
.,,rajudev,"That is fine. But for the time you have learned it. Did you like writing those 5-6 lines there, just to print Hello world",1515529263
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,"Actually noo..
I didn't like it's syntac",1515529330
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,Syntax,1515529336
.,,rajudev,"We have a thing that we should start asking. 
You got your problem solved here. 
Think of how much you'll learn, when you interact with us or the awesome devs here in the group. 

#AttendMeetups",1515529432
.,,rajudev,"Java is actually great, but it is too much learning and very little work which can be achieved using them.",1515529494
.,,rajudev,Take a look at Ionic,1515529510
cocoa,,cocoa1231,(and that extends and implements syntax is just dumb..),1515529522
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I really was confused when learning Android Studio by that,1515529541
.,,rajudev,Ionic,1515529554
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,What is this..??,1515529565
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yeah. But I have a mental block against JavaScript which I have to seriously get over,1515529575
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I was using Kivy+Python,1515529581
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,For android?,1515529616
.,,rajudev,"What if I tell you, learn HTML/CSS/JS/Angular and you can develop serious apps",1515529622
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,Web apps or android apps,1515529657
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Android Apps,1515529672
cocoa,,cocoa1231,(and with kivy you can make cross platform apps with the same codebase),1515529687
cocoa,,cocoa1231,(But I suggest ionic for android apps),1515529701
.,,rajudev,https://ionicframework.com/,1515529708

.,,rajudev,"Code in things you already know. HTML, CSS, JS",1515529802
cocoa,,cocoa1231,For me that's python,1515529813
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But I was asking does the codebase change if you change the platform?,1515529832
.,,rajudev,"My laptop is down, otherwise I would have shared screenshots",1515529833
cocoa,,cocoa1231,With Ionic,1515529845

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Nice! So pseudo-Kivy on Javascript!,1515529882
cocoa,,cocoa1231,(HTML/CSS too),1515529890
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,What would be better python or js as I havnt started any of the two,1515529901
.,,rajudev,"For most people that's HTML, CSS, JS",1515529905
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"For your purpose, js",1515529912
.,,rajudev,"Python is getting powers to do web apps, while JS is making it's ways to a lot of native apps.",1515529962
.,,rajudev,Yes,1515530009
cocoa,,cocoa1231,All of these platforms are great. What I wanna know is can you code an android app in Lua :P,1515530057
cocoa,,cocoa1231,That would be fuckin' interesting!,1515530067
Shreeyanshi,Gupta,,.??,1515530087
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Making android apps is the farthest thing a programming language like lua should be able to do. So if it could, that'd be interesting",1515530148
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Not for actually making android apps,1515530154
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Just for seeing what it'd be like,1515530159

.,,rajudev,"To use these executables instead of the ones provided by the package manager one, we did the bashrc stuff. To point your system to these executables instead of looking for them in repos.",1515531225
.,,rajudev,"looks like everyone, really slept",1515531256
cocoa,,cocoa1231,So the older versions are better?,1515531281
.,,rajudev,I am not implying to that statement.,1515531311
.,,rajudev,They are older because the maintainer didn't package a newer version of it.,1515531364
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Okay. Not better,1515531380
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Stable-er?,1515531384
.,,rajudev,Not bad either.,1515531393
.,,rajudev,Tried and tested. That is what Debian assures you atleast,1515531426
.,,rajudev,"I am implying to the fact that, when she will try to do something like adb devices . adv command would not be found, unless she executes them from that directory path",1515531506
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yeah, but just add those executables to PATH and you're done",1515531547
.,,rajudev,And adb or fastboot and stuff is the stuff she'll encounter sometime down the line,1515531621
.,,rajudev,Or you can also install them via apt/dnf/emerge/pacman when required. 😄,1515531683
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yeah. That works too :),1515531714

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"And since she is already familiar with HTML/CSS, it'll be easier for her to code the GUI",1515604039

Shashank,Kumar,realslimshanky,"Pelican is a static site generator. So netlify, github pages and other services which we can give our front end files (html, css, js) will work.

karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,"so was just wondering if it plugs into that, or would it have to be done manually",1518494222
Shashank,Kumar,realslimshanky,Pelican comes with an option of providing your github configuration so it's easier while deployment. All it does after saving the conf is run the same old git push. Similary you can also modify the pelican configurations to support netlify api.,1518494788
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,fair enough.,1518494810
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,so is there any advantage to using pelican over something like hugo? other than the fact that it's written in python?,1518494838
Shashank,Kumar,realslimshanky,I don't think so. Both of the tools use templates to give out static websites. I chose pelican because I'm more efficienct with Python than Go.,1518494915
Shashank,Kumar,realslimshanky,"Applications for the Outreachy May 2018 to August 2018 internships
are now open:

https://www.outreachy.org/apply/

Outreachy is paid, remote, three month internship program that helps
people traditionally underrepresented in tech make their first
contributions to Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) communities.
Interns are paid a stipend of $5,500 and a travel stipend of $500.

https://www.outreachy.org

The timeline for this round is:

Feb. 12, 2018 Applicants start making contributions to internship projects
March 22, 2018 Application deadline
April 23, 2018 Accepted interns announced
May 14, 2018 to Aug. 14, 2018 Internships period

Please read through the application instructions and eligibility
requirements carefully. The instructions have changed quite a lot since
the last Outreachy round.

Applicants will need to complete an eligibility form before they can
start working with mentors. Applicants will need to record their
in-progress contributions on the Outreachy website. Once one
contribution is recorded, applicants can start to work on the final
application for the internship project.

We currently have 13 Free and Open Source communities who are ready to
take contributions from applicants, and we expect to have about five
more join in the next couple of weeks. We'll send another announcement
once we have their landing pages in place.

If you have any questions about eligibility after you fill out your
eligibility form, please contact organizers@outreachy.org. If you can't
get in contact with a mentor or you're having trouble choosing which
project(s) to apply to, you can contact our mentors mailing list at
mentors@lists.outreachy.org

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"So let's have a selection of operating systems, right? We'll need Ubuntu and linux mint USBs. I'll bring those. If anyone wants an arch install, I can help with that provided there is fast internet. What else

Maybe something red hat based would be nice to have. Someone should bring a Fedora, CentOS, and openSUSE live USB. 

And of course, it wouldn't be complete without a Debian live usb",1520925519
Kartik,Mudgal,kartik1807,yes,1520925533
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,Ubuntu and Mint only for this one. We'll do arch for those who get interedted after this one.,1520925549

Kartik,Mudgal,kartik1807,oops?,1520925648
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Someone who's well versed with OpenSUSE's package manager Zypper would be required for suse installs. Zypper is tricky,1520925671
Kuntal,M,hellozee,none of us are,1520925697
cocoa,,cocoa1231,True. I'll get to work on that. I'll try to figure out zypper before friday,1520925721
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But there will probably be no one who wants OpenSUSE.,1520925742
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Most people will want Mint or Ubuntu, so we'll need more USBs of that",1520925759
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"better keep, mint for those who are new, debian and manjaro for those who want to explore..",1520925770

Banana,,nihilist_banana,"There are probably no prerequisites other than wanting to learn. I'm guessing the 'party' will consist of volunteers installing Linux in other people's systems.

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Just as an example,1523780712

If you work on kernel this boot information is very useful! (also one should check with freedos! for boot loafers)

cocoa,,cocoa1231,What are you trying to do?,1524769453
Chirag,Sehra,ChiragSehra,I was thinking to install it again. I think this must be something related to partitioning and space,1524769498

cocoa,,cocoa1231,The USB is formatted in EXT4. Windows can't detect that,1524769558

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yea,1524769588
cocoa,,cocoa1231,And you won't get to see all partitions,1524769597
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,sorry to interrupt but can i ask why?,1524769662
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Some of them aren't actually available to be read, so what you'll have to do is either directly burn another ISO using something like dd or Eitcher, or if you want you can open up the pendrive in gparted and then create a new partition table and so on. But the latter would be too complicated. Just burn another image onto the whole pendrive (and not a partition)",1524769671
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"It's because when an ISO is burnt onto a pendrive, the ISO overrides the pendrive's partition table.",1524769722
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,oh cool,1524769759
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"So it usually depends on the ISO, but for Linux ISOs, you usually just have 1 readable partition containing the efi directory, which is formatted as fat32",1524769762
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,yeah once i noted that,1524769777
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Sorry I can't give a more detailed answer. I haven't looked into why the ISOs do this yet,1524769779
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,i formatted my usb stick once in arch and it was formatted in fat32 partition,1524769808

Chirag,Sehra,ChiragSehra,Primary or extended?,1524770205

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Things to sort out:

Venue (we always have NIPFP, and there will be a new metro station nearby it, so commute will be much much easier), talks (I keep a poll here, and will ping the winning speakers), social media (out of my wheelhouse),  posters (once again, can't help there), and on-venue management (we'll cross that bridge when we get to it).",1526992046

Gourav,Chawla,gouravchawla,"At my office we are exploring different options of setting up our test enviornment. What would you guys suggest would be the best approach - buying our own hardware and setting up a server in our office or getting it from a provider like Digital ocean, aws.  Server configuration that we are considering is 12 core processer(s), 28-32 GB memory, 3TB+ Harddisk, OS -  Fedora. Stack - Django, Angular, SOLR, Redis, Nginx",1527165947
Ashutosh,Singh,juggernaut451,Does any have a good resource to start with kuberenets?,1527165988
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,"If have dedicated resources to manage servers which includes an ac room, stealth power source and IT guys, buying server is a good option",1527166027
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,SSD over HDD,1527166066
Gourav,Chawla,gouravchawla,"Ac, power should not be an issue.",1527166153
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Also i learned one thing the hard way dealing with servers! Make cron jobs for regular backups on a RAID tower or use server as VM manager to spin off diff VM when required and backup snapshots...,1527166158
Gourav,Chawla,gouravchawla,Noted.,1527166166
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Hardware RAID on server + backup on external tower if having critical logs,1527166200
Gourav,Chawla,gouravchawla,Thanks for that. Although in our case that is already in place.,1527166228
Gourav,Chawla,gouravchawla,"It's for testing, so backup won't be required here. Production server has all this in place.",1527166288
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,But what about backing up test logs ?,1527166323
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,We have an nfs mounted partition to store test logs..,1527166349
Gourav,Chawla,gouravchawla,Noted. I'll keep that in mind.,1527166380
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Bdw do you use any framework for automated testing or just scripts ?,1527166504
Gourav,Chawla,gouravchawla,"No, we don't. Atleast not yet.",1527166619
cocoa,,cocoa1231,,1527168806
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,"In the long runs, this might cost less given the environment stays suitable for the hardware as Ayan mentioned. Although, given the management, this requires a person with very good hardware and operating systems skills, I think. I'd pass setting up own environment since I won't be sure of power, management and the cost initially.",1527169147
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,👍🏼,1527169202
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,"They won't be as critical, would they?",1527169259
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,Do you write tests in your code?,1527169292
Gourav,Chawla,gouravchawla,"Okay. I suggested cloud for the same reason. But it was pointed out that we run apps locally on our system and we do that without any problem. So, how would that be any different when we buy our own hardware. Isn't it just a box where we install the OS and install, deploy our app. I don't have any experience with this, so I couldn't counter it.",1527169530
Gourav,Chawla,gouravchawla,No. 😭,1527169543
Gourav,Chawla,gouravchawla,But the force is strong and we shall start in the near future.,1527169643
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,"It won't be different on the software side of things but say for example, some days later, you have to increase the space, you'll require to fix hardware as well. In case of cloud, it'll again be some steps from their respecctive dashboard to go about increasing it, thats it.",1527169700
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,"That's good. So, I believe when you say a 'test setup', you're trying to replicate your production and see if things are running fine and hope that they would be fine in prod env too",1527169757
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,?,1527169757
Gourav,Chawla,gouravchawla,"Yes, that is an advantage cloud has to offer.",1527169758
Gourav,Chawla,gouravchawla,Yes.,1527169776
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,I see. Not a good practice. But you know it already and you're working toward it so it should be fine. :),1527169832
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,Take suggestions from more people of varying experience then make a decision.,1527169855

T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,http://kubernetesbyexample.com/,1527170056
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,"For people like me working in embedded/hardware industry we prefer local servers to stay as close as to real case scenario especially for testing. Also I work on time critical or say real time applications so test results on cloud servers varies because of bandwidth stuff. But if you dont have any such extra requirements cloud servers are better, and your company will produce slight less carbon footprints😅 , although its a good skill to maintain server racks :)",1527170064

No problem. 
- Header font could be increased by 2px. 
- The XXX could be removed and the content could be shifted to occupy the space. 
- Also, the line above the logo could be shifted above since it is too close to it. 

You're doing a great job. Just maybe take a little care of the space management. The main content should take the majority space right!!

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Maybe we should fix that?,1527846736
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Who has authorization to access the server?,1527846747
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,i find this thing pretty good as we i get my password which most of time i forgot,1527846782
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yeah, but it's not very secure",1527846816
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Many people use the same email and password for many things. If this one is leaked, lots of other things follow",1527846833
Kuntal,M,hellozee,mailman can generate a random string for you,1527846838
Kuntal,M,hellozee,which you can change from time to time,1527846857
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yeah, but people don't use that na",1527846884
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,sorry going offtopic but kuntat are you joing us for PyCon India,1527846895
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"nope, I am broke",1527846906
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"When coding something, you should do it from the perspective that the user will try their darnest to break your code.",1527846914
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,Ohkay,1527846914
cocoa,,cocoa1231,So it's better to at least store the hash of the password,1527846924
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Computerphile: How NOT to Store Passwords! - Computerphile,1527846934
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,Right. And this is the way many projects go about it.,1527847121
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,We do not have access to the server. Haven't tried anyway to fix this.,1527847145
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Oh. How is this hosted then?,1527847166
vipulgupta2048,,vipulgupta2048,"I agree, i would like if we don't get the reminders altogether. How about it.",1527847167
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,"It is maintained by the LinuxChix core community people, not the chapter leads",1527847259
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,I think that should be possible,1527847277
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"My 2 cents:
Almost every other project of whom I have joined the mailing lists stores the password as plain text, this starts from normal ones like Inkscape to pretty serious ones like xorg, there might be some reason for doing that?
Also I think there is a warning about the same thing whenever you are signing up.",1527847348
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,Yeah warning is there,1527847623
cocoa,,cocoa1231,And the reason being?,1527847717
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"Who knows, from what I have searched over the last couple of minutes it seems like, there are more serious issues which are related to SMTP than this plain text thing",1527847833
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But why leave something broken when it's so easily fixable?,1527847867
Kuntal,M,hellozee,@cocoa1231 got your aglet broken ehh?,1527847892
cocoa,,cocoa1231,:P,1527847904
Kuntal,M,hellozee,I almost took a screenshot of it,1527847921
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Hehe,1527847928
cocoa,,cocoa1231,changed the password :P,1527847932
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,Change it every month you receive the reminder. Maybe reminders are meant for that.,1527848052
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Wasn't talking about that password. I accedentally posted my PC's ssh information, including the password in the chat :P",1527848099
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,Oh.,1527848109

PS: I don't want to offend anyone or start a controversy. A humble observation",1528642693

Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,"It's very kind of you to take such an initiative, Vipul. And I present my utmost regards to you for helping us out too.

Yes it's somewhere saddening that despite all the efforts of so many people, we aren't able to convince a lot of women that it's for their betterment to attend the meetups.

But, of course I feel there is utter lack of volunteers in LinuxChix India who can have shared responsibilities to make the community a success. We need more volunteers so that there isn't just one or two people doing all the work and we're growing ourselves as a community.",1528644053
Sakshi,Sangwan,sakshi04,"I don't know if it's a genuine problem or not but sharing from my own experience. First of all coming to the first meetup requires some will because you have no clue what to expect, just asking people doesn't help, you need to push and accompany them.
Next thing being there, not knowing anyone, kind of feels awkward because one doesn't know what to do.
I suppose this could be one of the reasons people give up after a meetup or two.",1528651681
Philomath,,miphilomath,That is how I felt for the first time,1528652943
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,I understand. What can we do to push women to come to meetups?,1528653014
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Arey i am expert in this,1528653203
Pranjal,Vyas,vyaspranjal33,😂,1528653227
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"From the Adobe Meetup I have learnt one thing is that there is a singnificant number of females who are interested in learning stuff, but due to large number of groups the number of females per community is small, we can hold combined meetups like the one we had in Adobe to allow them to mix with other groups.",1528653253

Pulkit,Goyal,pulkitgoyal,+1,1528653513
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Oooh yes! We should hold a meetup for all the women-in-tech communities one day!,1528653591
Sakshi,Sangwan,sakshi04,"As vipul suggested 'each one bring one' could be the motto. I suppose all of us at least know one female who would be interested. Let's try and accompany them to a few meetups, make them understand why they should attend meetups 😅",1528653688
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,Sounds good. Does it mean we restrict entries to people who can only bring females interested in our meeting?,1528653865
Kuntal,M,hellozee,eeii that's not fair,1528653910
Pradhvan,Bisht,Pradhvan,Woah ! Woah ! Woah ! I think she meant encourage people during the meetup,1528653976
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,"Of course there are many who are interested. And I understand the fear of not being able to come out and mingle with other people of same interests. I had that too. A friend told me to once attend it (ILUGD's), I did and liked it so continued.

How do we ensure that women at least come to the Meetup for once?

For a few who do not turn up the second time, I have have an observation that they're shy, not talking to people and talks get a little too much for them to understand since they are sophomore students.
What can we do to fix this?",1528654043
Sanyam,Khurana,CuriousLearner,😂😂😂😂,1528654055
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"Nice, and now everyone is active @shivanib",1528654135
Philomath,,miphilomath,"With sharing experience of those who have attended it via blog post, videos of talks, images etc.",1528654184
Pradhvan,Bisht,Pradhvan,I don't know if it's a bad idea or what. But you guys could do a all women meetup after every 3-4 meetups just like for women's day meetup. A lot of women showed up and were super interested to learn.,1528654210
Sakshi,Sangwan,sakshi04,"That wouldn't be fair 😅
But I guess people here would be happy to help in doing so.",1528654218
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,"Haha. We've been advised to actually do that multiple times.
I understand it is unfair, there are men who enjoy coming to our meetups because they're just interested in learning things. But, how do we ensure that everyone who comes to the Meetup has tried to help the community grow by getting more women in?",1528654223
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,That was the point of that statement.,1528654251
Sakshi,Sangwan,sakshi04,In the previous community call there was one suggestion of starting a series. Can we do something like that?,1528654340
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"Nice defense, 😜😝",1528654382
T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,Yup only women thing should be done.,1528654385

Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,"So, I heard from today's organizers that the distro fix-up thing was something very successful. Maybe we should do that in every meetup",1528654410
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,"Focus on content quality, meetup should not be just and only about learning! If you can showcase its a FUN way to learn more people will want to join",1528654453

Sakshi,Sangwan,sakshi04,Yess +1,1528654484

Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Announce free swag for women participants,1528654634
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,I can contribute,1528654642
Kuntal,M,hellozee,that is a nice idea,1528654676
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,"I like how ILUGD has managed to grow this much and I believe a large part of the credit goes to different volunteers who organize, look for venue, record talks, edit them, put on YouTube, etc.
Which is exactly how things should happen.

That's what this community needs.",1528654698
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,@shivanib agreed,1528654720
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,This sounds good,1528654745
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Actually LCI starts by announcing ‘’We are looking for women soeakers’’ and if no one turns up ask any speaker available for talk! This might be spreading message it’s only for women community and this might be restricting volunteers,1528654785
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Just my opinion,1528654796
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,,1528654857
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,,1528654857

Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,LCI can give shoutout to female community members like this,1528654869
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,"So, we started off with an idea that in every meetup there should be at least one woman speaker to encourage women to speak and feel more inclusive of community. Now, for a good time, there have been issues created by men on GitHub and there are always enough talks but no issues by women, hence we start looking for women speakers.
But yes it might be confusing to new people",1528654920
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,Thank you for this.,1528654949
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Post call for speakers to other community mailing lists as well,1528654964

Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,Oh we did ask them this time.,1528654993
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,But yes only them.,1528655007
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,"Please identify for what specific tasks LCI needs volunteers, be specific and assign only one task to one volunteer . We need volunteers is quite generic . If we have a task list people can pick from list what they think can do best !",1528655084
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,OK. We can do this.,1528655111
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Great! We can have a community call to discuss this if required !,1528655130

cocoa,,cocoa1231,And the community is in it's infancy too right now. It'll be better to migrate now,1528709022
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,😂😂😂😂,1528709025
cocoa,,cocoa1231,whatis strace,1528709131
Garvit,Khatri,garvitdelhi,"hahaha, my personal belief is not to rush and change just because of the memes, I would suggest you guys to wait for sometime",1528709151
Garvit,Khatri,garvitdelhi,moreover gitlab is not in a stable condition right now,1528709159
Garvit,Khatri,garvitdelhi,*,1528709180
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I''ve been using gitlab for quite a while. It's a pretty great platform.,1528709201
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,nothing appropriate,1528709214
cocoa,,cocoa1231,And it's open source too. We can shift to git.fosscommunity.org/linuxchixin,1528709216
cocoa,,cocoa1231,git.fosscommunity.com *,1528709241
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Look at the man page of strace,1528709259
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,cocoa please check your dm,1528709269
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,oohk,1528709271
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,no manual entry for strace,1528709293
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Hey. How about all of the communities go to git.fosscommunity.com? So anyone can find out about a foss community by just going to git.fosscommunity.com/<communityName>,1528709296
cocoa,,cocoa1231,install it,1528709301
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,Why is that?,1528709312
cocoa,,cocoa1231,@rajudev What was the URL of the gitlab instance by the FOSS Communities?,1528709384
Garvit,Khatri,garvitdelhi,"https://monitor.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/github-importer?orgId=1
this just tells they are not ready to handle load rn",1528709399
Garvit,Khatri,garvitdelhi,i am not against using a hosted version of the gitlab's software,1528709409
Garvit,Khatri,garvitdelhi,but again that is another pain al together,1528709415
cocoa,,cocoa1231,One is already hosted by FOSS Community.,1528709447
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I don't remember the URL,1528709454
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,The one you found about yesterday? :P,1528709520
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yeah,1528709600
Garvit,Khatri,garvitdelhi,"haha, also I believe your community has been working seriously for a lot of time",1528709608
Garvit,Khatri,garvitdelhi,more than a couple of years i believe?,1528709625
Garvit,Khatri,garvitdelhi,making such a changes is not good for future stability,1528709633
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yeah,1528709637
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,@cocoa1231: https://git.fosscommunity.in/,1528709638
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Bingo!,1528709657
Garvit,Khatri,garvitdelhi,"PS: I have meeting, will catch up in 1/2 an hour",1528709677
cocoa,,cocoa1231,The community is really small still. So I think it'll be easier to migrate now rather than later when the community grows to the size of something like ILUGD or PyDelhi (hopefully),1528709710
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"It's nice.
I tried a bit. Have a look at this, everyone.
CC: @cocoa1231 @shivanib",1528709734

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Let's see,1528709834
cocoa,,cocoa1231,We'll discuss this in the community call,1528709840
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,cocoa are there some easy steps to shift from github to gitlab?,1528709860
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,Wednesday? Community call @9pm?,1528709869
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,coz i am new to guthub too so i need some guidance,1528709883
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yup. It's a one-click shift. Literally. Gitlab provides it,1528709890
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,oohk i will see,1528709900
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Create a gitlab account, and then just import all your projects from github",1528709906
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"So don't use Github?
Is there anything to shift? -.-",1528709930

Sanyam,Khurana,CuriousLearner,"Ek Koshan

Why migrate?",1528711421
.,,rajudev,nope. My office ends at 9.30 PM. Would not be available till atleast 10.30 better do it without me. Or do a morning call.,1528711569
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Two reasons I can think of:
1) We're a FOSS community promoting FOSS. It'll be better if our main platform is FOSS too. And especially not owned by Microsoft
2) Gitlab has more features and it'll be deploy-able on our own servers. We can use the domain linuxchix.in for the actual server if we want to. And then we can have linuxchix.in/talks redirect to git.linuxchix.in/talks/issues or something.",1528711656
cocoa,,cocoa1231,It doesn't have to be gitlab though. Any open source git server would do the job,1528711672
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Gitlab seems the best one so far,1528711680
cocoa,,cocoa1231,When in the morning?,1528711831
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Or we can shift it to 10 PM too,1528711847

cocoa,,cocoa1231,That was my answer to it,1528712004
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Why not though?,1528712013
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"It's feasible to do. We're a small community right now, so why not?",1528712135

Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Git.fosscommunity.in,1528728946
Sanyam,Khurana,CuriousLearner,"My 2 paisa:

1. Github supports FOSS. It is now owned by Microsoft doesn't mean that it is no more FOSS. Have they changed there privacy policy or something that makes you uncomfortable?

2. You can do all that in Github too. 

IMHO, owning a server presents it's own set of problems:

 - Who will maintain the server",1528729091
Sanyam,Khurana,CuriousLearner,"- Who will have access to the server?
- who pays for keeping services up and running",1528729117
Sanyam,Khurana,CuriousLearner,"One more thing, in case you people want to go ahead, there is one thing you should take care of, and that is redirecting the DNS of current site to appropriate server.

I wouldn't personally do this, because I don't have so much time at disposle to shift things and maintain them, while they're taken care of by Github for now.",1528729195

Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,+1,1528729338
vipulgupta2048,,vipulgupta2048,"I agree on that, really if people are less. Than handling a server is an entire task in itself that you could easily break",1528729355

vipulgupta2048,,vipulgupta2048,We blocked ourselves out of the server once by starting the firewall without opening port 22. Many things like this happen very frequently with servers,1528729426

Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,I guess once they used to be among top linux contributors org list,1528729687
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"1. It's not about github being owned by microsoft. I mean, it obviously is one of the factors, but it's not the main reason I'm pushing for it. I want to use it because we're a FOSS community and we should use FOSS as much as possible. I never liked github (not saying they didn't do fantastic work), and I wanted us to use gitlab for a long time because it's open source software. And there already exists git.fosscommunity.in, which needs volenteers to administrate

2. You cannot do a lot of things in github that you can in gitlab. One of my favourite features is using SSH keys for pushing stuff (Just an example, there's a lot of other stuff).

Main point being, Microsoft buying github was just an excuse for me to get this conversation going. We don't use whatsapp for communication in communities, even though it's widely used. Telegram is open source (partly), has more features and is just better overall. Just saying, use FOSS for community purposes as much as possible",1528730750

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Okay. So let's list out what all we have to do and start assigning stuff,1528735896

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Thanks a lot :),1528735914
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,firstly how many we are expecting this time,1528735948
cocoa,,cocoa1231,That all depends on how well we advertise it,1528735966
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,Yeah,1528736001
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,shivani di and priyal di will decide,1528736030
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Spam all forms of social media. Keep the LCI twitter and facebook pages alive throughout. Announce the speakers/workshops beforehand like PyCon does,1528736050
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,what if we have a small talk on basic of bash as many of us wants to learn basic bash commands and if we expect new members then they would also like to know about this,1528736167
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yes. We should do that. We can have like a 15 minute introduction to bash in the beginning of the meetup. We can change that 15 minute to higher or lower depending upon how much time we have,1528736220
Sakshi,Sangwan,sakshi04,It says July 15 on meetup,1528736224
Kuntal,M,hellozee,even half an hour is too low for the basics of bash,1528736251
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,in june we can have one more coz there are vacations so we can expect more members,1528736258
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Probably not right. right @shivanib @priyal_trivedi ?,1528736261
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,@cocoa1231 so if you are not coming to next meetup who would be giving the talk on bash basics?,1528736353
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Anyone can. We can figure out someone experienced who will (hint hint @rajudev [if you can]),1528736385
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Okay guys. Gotta go for dinner. Let's continue this tomorrow. Or you all can keep discussing.,1528736440

After every meetup, we should release the feedback form for attendees to ask for their reviews, suggestions and rating for each talk delievered, along with suggestions/reviews for organisers for the next meetup.  It'll literally help speakers as well as organisers to improve upon and conduct upcoming meetups even much more smoothly & in a much better way. :)",1529861218

Like check out reddit.com/r/darkjokes, I didn't initially think that it was about people being bigots, mainly because I wasn't thinking of these jokes coming from people who are truly awful, rather I just read these jokes in the voice of a certain comedian I love. So it kindof undercut the actual awfulness of the jokes. But my sister then, correctly, pointed this out, and it was really interesting to see how much it depends on your internal voice that reads the joke (or statement)

T K,Sourabh,tk_sourabh,Welcome @soumyajindal. @cli_ninja @shivanib she needed help with getting started with kernel development (hardware part).,1530020265
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Welcome @soumyajindal,1530020565
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Post your queries here and we shall try our best to get you started :),1530020579
Soumya,Jindal,soumyajindal,"Hey, thanks for having me!
I am new to open source and want to get started with kernel development (preferably hardware end). I have started reading the book from Robert Love, would you suggest any other resources?",1530021683
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,"I suggest to read functioning of harware based communication protocols like 

UART , i2c, SPI, 1 wire, CAN , LIN , MODBUS etc and check the driver codes available in kernel tree!",1530022169
Soumya,Jindal,soumyajindal,"Okay, I’ll go through this. Thanks!",1530022420
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Are you studying currently ?,1530022478
Soumya,Jindal,soumyajindal,I just completed my bachelors in CSE.,1530023020
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,"Hi, @soumyajindal !
When you talk about kernel development, you can ideally contribute to two parts: user space (responsible for all the communication with underlying kernel) and kernel space.
Kernel is the glue between your hardware and the internals so I'm not very sure if you can call something as hardware part of kernel. As @cli_ninja correctly pointed out, I believe you're looking for device drivers and communication (again, not all kernel modules are device drivers so maybe it won't fit). Anyway, you'll have to learn writing the modules and maybe based on specification sheets for the hardware you're targeting and the right protocol you can move forward.
A very basic guide is: https://unixia.wordpress.com/2017/04/23/writing-your-first-linux-kernel-module/",1530024418
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,@cli_ninja thoughts? Comments? Correct or incorrect as per you?,1530024445
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,"Absolutely! I think the same way, she meant using kernel to control hardware which can range from memory management to sensors to a new USB device and the best way to start developing for them is to know about the underlying communication protocol and get familiar with libs available in kernel tree to use them. And that blog post is really helpful @shivanib 😊",1530024894
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,If anyone wants to build a device driver USB sub system I believe is the easiest to start with! Get any latest USB gadget from market and write it’s driver! Maybe it finds a place upstream 😊,1530024954
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Build —> Write*,1530024979
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Also best way to reach DD development is to start with system programming —> RTOS —> Device tree overlays,1530025013
Kuntal,M,hellozee,@cli_ninja  any pointers on how can I interface an arduino with my pcie slot?,1530025083
Kuntal,M,hellozee,apparently I have a free pcie slot in my  laptop,1530025147
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,"Arduino microcontroller can do ICSP, i2c , SPI, UART but not PCIe! So you can either select a microcontroller which has PCIe bus or use arduino GPIOs to bitbang and behave as a PCIe device . PCIe requires highly timed communication hence am not sure if bitbang would do since with arduino you can go max 1MHz i guess (not sure) but someone might have already tried it! Have to check",1530025216
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"hmm, I was thinking of the GPIOs that way I get to write a kernel module, :P",1530025283
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,True that but that would only work with your custom firmware running on controller,1530025313
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Try controlling arduino GPIOs connected to your PC over file system in /sysfs fashion,1530025370
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Write a module which will mount ir as a fs when connected via USB,1530025386
Kuntal,M,hellozee,sounds cool,1530025413
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,"Hint: check FIRMATA pyFIRMATA, you can extend it for this",1530025429
Kuntal,M,hellozee,sure,1530025525
Soumya,Jindal,soumyajindal,"@shivanib, yes that’s what I meant.

Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Okay, so I was planning  automating this stuff.
How?: There would be a proper format to post in the meetup description. Once that is set, I'll use Meetup's API to fetch the details and the form would be generated.
Then, if required, one could make changes or could share the link simply.

Aakash,Saini,,"Pick up any kernel book and try to understand basics of kernel.. like atomics, locks, interrupts & handlers, mem mgmt... so on!!
You basic about kernel fundamental should be very loud&clear.

Next while getting your hands on kernel logics, make sure you understand the programming language well enough. Ex. Use of registers, volatiles etc.

Before kernel is loaded your system performs lot of operations like PrePOST, POST, BIOS/Firmware.. then bootloaders. From bootloaders you go to markers of kernel boot images, thereby loading device drivers (buses..).

If want to focus kernel, then just focus kernel, else you will confuse with huge resources attached to kernel. 

Any book on kernel will initially work good to logically understand how kernel works. Once you are through with basics.. will guide you to next level.

Bootloaders, device drivers, filesystem all go along with kernel, but initially avoid putting your hand on it.",1530102047

1. You don’t know C/Lang, but will look-at it!! (You need to swim in C)
2. You want to learn basics, but development and managing is advance.
LHS != RHS
3. You need both kernel/driver knowledge for IoT h/w deployments (specially customized)
4. Prior to kernel/driver knowledge you need to know **relevant computer architecture** that you work on.
5. Compilers & kernel code have variants since Linux 1.0 source code! Those old variants respective to kernel still not changed.
6. Much kernel code is in assembly language, if you don’t know, go back to step 1.
7. Managing bugs means kernel proficiency (writing kernel is easier then debugging kernel).

8. Lot of things are involved. First you need enjoy swimming in C!!

Aakash,Saini,,"Ok! There is some confusion. Let me explain in simplest form.

Kernel/customs & build/customs are 2 different things.

What you talked about build/customs is like what all is needed for compilation. If any module/driver not needed can be removed from compilation but editing scripts.

Whereas *that* gentleman talked about kernel/customs. Why customer kernels, bcoz your kernel is x86 (intel/amd) based using PCIe bus and whereas he is talking about IoT embedded devices using serial busses with ARM micro controllers.

Here at kernel/customs customizes entire kernel code based on ARM architecture.
ARM is RISC, where as Intel/AMD is CISC, and many more differences.

I hope now you understand what is the difference between kernel/customization & build/customization.

Architecture differs!! 
Openwrt based Linux devices does not use PCI/PCIe buses.

Please correct me!😊",1530734986

Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,okay,1530807070
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,We should consult @cocoa1231 for this,1530807113
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"We should.
I've seen 3 others getting stuck on the same problem.
CC: @cocoa1231",1530807124

Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,aap tb btana jab hum thak jaaye ki ab humse nhi ho rha,1530807658
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,It’s not about running commands,1530807659
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,It’s about tracing to root cause,1530807667
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,And nail it your way!,1530807671
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,"yeah , well i know that now",1530807681

Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,sure,1530807699
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,That would do,1530807706
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Just a ramdom, stupid question,
What would happen if I delete my grub config file?",1530807932
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,u have to get it back🤣🤣🤣,1530808038
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,by just sudo grub-update,1530808132
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,"nothing , you will be stuck at grub -rescue mode",1530808144
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,yeh nhi kaam kregi?,1530808179
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yup. Let's do that,1530808186
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"And yeah, I already have grub failures in my chaos engineering list ;)",1530808201
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"I'm not publically sharing the list, because then it'll give away the solution",1530808214
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,"hahah , great",1530808214
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"it will only work in Debian based distros, I think",1530808221
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yeah,1530808227
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Not debian too, I think ubuntu",1530808233

Kuntal,M,hellozee,have you gone through Arch Wiki?,1530808250
cocoa,,cocoa1231,sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg,1530808250
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Will do the same thing,1530808255
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,yeah it doesnt work in debian,1530808272
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Ohkay,1530808278
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Didn't know that,1530808281
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,how can i set a wallpaper in grub?,1530808291
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,and grub lock too,1530808295
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,i know this,1530808301
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Check out an app called grub-customizer,1530808305
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,and hide that on the time of boot,1530808310
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,Sikhaao hume bhi,1530808320
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,IRON MAN lagaunga😜,1530808338
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Jesus christ. genkernel is being emerged for the past 40 minutes...,1530808353
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,genkernel?,1530808373
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,aacha chalo kaunsa OS hai,1530808373
cocoa,,cocoa1231,How do you use gentoo @hellozee. The compilation times alone are so long,1530808374
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,ARCH,1530808379
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,chalo grub config file ka command,1530808399

Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,aage ssamjh jaoge,1530808411
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,Yaaa i saw raju bheiya compiling an application it took 3 hours,1530808418
Kuntal,M,hellozee,What are you compiling?,1530808423
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,yeh wali?,1530808426
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,yup,1530808431
cocoa,,cocoa1231,genkernel,1530808439
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Too lazy to compile my own kernel,1530808444
cocoa,,cocoa1231,,1530808458
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Compiling kernel takes roughly half an hour my side,1530808464
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Not the kernel,1530808469
cocoa,,cocoa1231,The genkernel package,1530808474
cocoa,,cocoa1231,just compiling the package...,1530808479
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,PMS pe ajaaao,1530808501
Kuntal,M,hellozee,it is compiling the OpenGL libraries,1530808537
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"I have never used genkernel though, using genkernel on gentoo doesn't make sense anyway",1530808572
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Why,1530808581
Kuntal,M,hellozee,You could simply download a precompiled kernel as genkernel compiles a machine agnostic generic kernel,1530808618
cocoa,,cocoa1231,genkernel all does that. I was hoping that I could pass a few arguments to genkernel and see if that compiles a slimmer kernel,1530808654
Kuntal,M,hellozee,bdw why genkernel is pulling mesa?,1530808683
Kuntal,M,hellozee,it doesn't depend on mesa,1530808691
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I have no idea. I just did emerge sys-kernel/genkernel,1530808699
cocoa,,cocoa1231,*,1530808709
Kuntal,M,hellozee,genkernel shouldn't need OpenGL,1530808709
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Where can I find the ebuilds of packages?,1530808766
Kuntal,M,hellozee,check the gentoo github,1530808788
cocoa,,cocoa1231,got it,1530808807
cocoa,,cocoa1231,danke,1530808808
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,"well , one more thing , those who wanna break grub , delete the grub config file and do command for grub file creatin",1530808857
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,,1530865756
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Facing this error :/
First about the PGP signatures.
And the other one being the ControlPort.
Couldn't find it on Google.",1530865768
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I'll tell when I get home,1530866978
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Oh,1530866988
cocoa,,cocoa1231,You're already using makepkg,1530866998
cocoa,,cocoa1231,You can do makepkg -sci --skippgpcheck to skip the checks,1530867030
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Make sure you trust the package though.,1530867040
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"Wow, I didn't knew makepkg has this flag",1530867104
Raghav,,Rwbhu,I am not able to get all the functionality of each flag from the man Pages...,1530867216
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Have to rely on stack exchange for the same,1530867229
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Which command's manpage?,1530867325
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Worked, thanks!",1530867421
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,Does this happen because I installed the package with pip which was to be installed with pacman?,1530867624
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"This is one of the things I don't like about pypi. Conflicts with local PMS

If these are all just python errors, feel free to do --force",1530867811
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"I read on some forum about it.
If I uninstall it via pip and install it via pacman, then it works.
Which means, I installed the package with pip which was to be installed with pacman.",1530867899
Raghav,,Rwbhu,I'm talking about manpage usage in general,1530867921
Raghav,,Rwbhu,It describes details but one still does not know how to use the command,1530867981
Raghav,,Rwbhu,And a composite command like nmcli,1530867996
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Nmcli con delete type Ethernet ip4 gw4,1530868018
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Damn long and tough to get the usage of nmcli from the manpage,1530868048
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yeah, it'll tell you the components of the command. If won't tell you how to compose it. It would be nice if they could add a few handy commands in the manpage, but eh, such is life",1530868099
cocoa,,cocoa1231,:P,1530868103
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"It's not so much meant to be installed with pacman, as much as pacman freaks out if other PMSes install something.",1530868149
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Ya so Linux kernel people should add these docs to the manpages,1530868156
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Why isn't that happening,1530868171
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Dunno. Maybe you should add it ;),1530868191
Raghav,,Rwbhu,How to do that,1530868206
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Choose a package and ask around in their forums or something. Not really sure of the specifics,1530868233
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Okay,1530868242
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"""Such is life"" :P",1530868782
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"Check out the examples section, I configured i3 within  a 3 day blackout (i.e 72 hours without internet) by only reading manpages. You can just use a program by following stackexchnage answers but manpages will teach you how to play with that",1530869236
Raghav,,Rwbhu,Actually shout-out to digital ocean tutorials on Linux ...they cover almost every topic under the sun,1530881956

Kuntal,M,hellozee,"Say, for the fact Gentoo is a meta distribution and is different from other normal distros like Debian/Arch/Fedora.
Not because of the installation process though.
You can plug in a BSD kernel, can have a different init system, heck can even ignore glibc and install musl in its place. Thus everyone has different distribution at the end.
A similar term, meta-package also exist for packages, for example xubuntu-desktop is not a normal package, it is meta package, which just helps to pull other packages which are needed for setting up a XFCE-4 desktop in Ubuntu, you can install each component separately but you get every package installed when you install xubuntu-desktop.
Just like that mew is meta package manager, which just provides a translation layer. Take for example you can speak English but in Mexico, people speak Spanish, so to visit Mexico you must learn Spanish or you can hire a translator for you. That translator is mew.",1531140318

Also, there's nothing wrong with a bhojpuri flavor of Linux being called hamra Linux. It can totally be a thing sometime. Similarly, there can be Amchi Linux and Mhara Linux.

Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,"okay , i have a thing to discuss , whenever there is some discussion going on , releated to venue , etc , we should discuss it in group itself rather going to DM , well its a public plus open group we should maintain transparency and try to involve more participations rather than going in DM , (Personal opinion @utkarsh2102 @cocoa1231 @shivanib ) what do u think ?",1531409505

But sometimes, there are situations which is better handled via one-to-one communication rather than the group.

The commands you enter into the terminal are handled by a program called a shell. It's like an interpreter that parses your commands and executes it. Shell scripts are just a series of commands for the shell in a file

Like python has it's interpreter and then it has python scripts which are a series of commands for the python interpreter. Exactly the same idea",1531728937

For instance, and I'll try to find a citation for this, but in a study of students giving the SAT, when Mexican, or African American children and women were not asked to specify their gender or ethnicity in the sign up sheet, they did same or even better than their white counterparts, but when they were asked to specify those details, they did worse.

But wait a bit. Lemme find a citation first before I stick by this claim",1531948389

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Plan one meetup ahead,1531980687
Priyal,Trivedi,priyal_trivedi,We should. We had also decided on that. But I think we need to remind each other constantly.,1531980723
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yeah. We also talked about having some kind of auditing system so that the changes discussed in calls were actually implemented,1531980775
Sakshi,Sangwan,sakshi04,"Well we were not sure whether to conduct this one or not 😅
August is already packed, and we are in talks for the September meetup 😋",1531980818

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Or we can combine ILUGD (on 4th) and LCI. Go for one big LUG meetup,1531980983

Priyal,Trivedi,priyal_trivedi,Cool with me,1531981212
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yeah. So @anuvrat (I don't know his handle) was in a community call. He said that on the initial days of PyDelhi, they'd have a meetup every two weeks. Even if one person came. And so did ilugd. I went to a meetup on ILUGD where 4 people came. The projector stopped working, so we all just sat around a laptop :P

Point being, that kind of consistency is good for getting more people",1531981290
Priyal,Trivedi,priyal_trivedi,Fair enough. Completely agree.,1531981326
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Awesome. So let's finalize the venue quickly :D,1531981343

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Maybe try,1532638658
Pulkit,Gera,darth_gera,yeah it installed,1532638723
Pulkit,Gera,darth_gera,next what,1532638726
cocoa,,cocoa1231,dhcpcd enp2s0,1532638736
cocoa,,cocoa1231,After you re connect the lan cable,1532638745
Pulkit,Gera,darth_gera,,1532638891
Pulkit,Gera,darth_gera,this is the output,1532638897

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Try doing something on the LAN,1532638926

cocoa,,cocoa1231,It probably won't show in the tray icon,1532638940

cocoa,,cocoa1231,ping 10.3.12.180,1532639119
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Seems like that's the default gateway,1532639130
Pulkit,Gera,darth_gera,actually i have to configure lan settings with proxy and all,1532639140
Pulkit,Gera,darth_gera,though ping is working,1532639157
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Proxy to access the web?,1532639173
cocoa,,cocoa1231,You can do that in your browser's settings,1532639182
Pulkit,Gera,darth_gera,no no its a bit more than that but thanks a lot,1532639217
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I'd have to know the specifics of the kind of proxy,1532639236
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Is it an http proxy?,1532639241
Pulkit,Gera,darth_gera,so in the future how do i connect to lan,1532639247
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Something is wrong with network manager, so this dhcpcd command does the job for now.",1532639276
Pulkit,Gera,darth_gera,"ight Click on Network icon on the top bar [ If it isn't there then try running ""nm-applet"" command on terminal.] If it doesn't shows anything then, you might have to install Network Manager Applet or equivalent, refer https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/NetworkManager

Give Connection name as ""Hostel Authentication"", check the ""Connect Automatically"" checkbox.
Click on 802.1 X Security tab, check the checkbox for ""Use 802.1X security for this connection.
Select Authentication type as PEAP (MSCHAPv2) and then enter your complete students/research email address and use the password generated using the portal given above.

Pulkit,Gera,darth_gera,okay,1532639484

cocoa,,cocoa1231,uptime tells you exactly that btw,1532639600
cocoa,,cocoa1231,And when was the last time you ran a full system upgrade. Maybe some core components got updated and need a reboot,1532639641
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Or maybe this network manager bug has been patched in the latest update, and you just need to download that",1532639677
Pulkit,Gera,darth_gera,that solution is arch linux specific,1532639990

cocoa,,cocoa1231,netctl is also available in ubuntu,1532640169

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"okay, it is not. But you don't need it.",1532640225
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Doing this much should be enough to check if you can connect or not,1532640257

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Well, just starting from a programmer's perspective, its just that setting up your environment is way easier and much more customizable. Its popular on servers because of how little resources it uses, and also on a wide variety of OBCs (On Board Computers). Its also used in many supercomputers since its kernel is open source, and so you can tweak it to optimize for a specific hardware. So i wouldn't say that Linux is hyped at all, considering the amount and variety of stuff it can do. So it's pretty helpful to know your way around a Linux shell

Those were (a few of) the pragmatic arguments. Now for the ethical ones.

Linux, or GNU/Linux, is based around the idea of Free and Open Source software. It is basically a philosophy which puts the user in control. Not some company, or some manufacture. You are the one who has complete control of your system. It respects your privacy, and ensures the right to modify, share and redistribute copies, allowing for creativity and variety of choices. It wants to keep the hacker culture alive

At the end of the day though, its up to you to figure out what best works for you. If windows does the job, and you aren't concerned about the ethical issues, then there really is no need to change :)",1532686496

cvam0000,,cvam0000,"OS from microsoft and apple are considered proprietary operating system i.e
- you can not see the code to create the operating system

- You, therefore, cannot change the operating system at its most basic levels if it 

doesn’t suit your needs — and you can’t use the operating system to build your 

own operating system from source code

- You cannot check the code to fi nd bugs, explore security vulnerabilities, or simply learn what that code is doing.

- You may not be able to easily plug your own software into the operating system if the creators of that system don’t want to expose the programming interfaces you need to the outside world",1532689125
cvam0000,,cvam0000,"-Google runs thousands upon thousands of Linux servers to power its search technology. Its Android phones are based on Linux. Likewise, when you download and run Google’s Chrome OS, you get a browser that is backed by a Linux operating system.

-Facebook builds and deploys its site using what is referred to as a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache web server, MySQL database, and PHP web scripting language) — all open source projects. In fact, Facebook itself uses an open source development model, making source code for the appli- cations and tools that drive Facebook available to the public.

Nikhil,Warke,nickdex,And know any program like cron which can run a script every 10 seconds,1532881446

drakula,,p5g41tmlx,Disown will remove the process from the joblist bas.. it'll be still there attached to the shell (iirc).. if the shell is destroyed the process is also killed or say it fails to read from stdin,1532883975

cocoa,,cocoa1231,"It is a form of that. But with the LCI CE Workshops, the idea is that not only you get to learn about the system, but you also take away more general problem solving skills that you can apply elsewhere. One of the major factors in that is that you learn how to learn yourself. You learn how and what to google/ddg, while more experienced people guide you through the problem",1533227818

drakula,,p5g41tmlx,Negative.. if there's rolling codes,1533475389
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,Rolling codes are implemented in car keys.. tho that can be hacked too..,1533475404
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,"And yes.. you'll have to read the freq using HackRF and then transmit the same..

Still works if there's nothing called rolling codes",1533475448

drakula,,p5g41tmlx,Mhm yea that's what I said.. rolling codes,1533475563
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Not exactly deends on what frequency hoping algo my tx and rx is using,1533475573
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,And aap wo same kaise rkhte ho??,1533475619
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,The receiver and the transmitter can calculate what will be the incoming frequency.. read the wiki page of rolling codes,1533475669
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,It's just a plain algorithm,1533475679
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Many ways ! One is Pre Shared Key! PSK you set same in firmware and flash it,1533475696
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,"There are things like 
PWM
PPM
CPOM
SBUS
IBUS
CRSF",1533475734
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,CPPM*,1533475742
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,This is one more way,1533475825

Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,I sniffed so many code just using a normal rtl sdr back in 2013,1533476008
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Now it’s hard!,1533476016
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,Haha yes.. they use the Rolling codes but now plain Bruteforce is not a good idea.. packet size got big,1533476040
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,Only way is to do HW RE..,1533476057
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Before car key send what next key it will be using so If you managed to jam it you get next code and you can unlock it,1533476067
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Infact you get 2 codes,1533476070
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,TBH i don't think kuch hoga isse,1533476073
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,Ha.. you can just set a sniffer.. which will sniff the 'next' packet and then can replay,1533476109
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,But ab esa ni,1533476113
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,Hota,1533476114
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,They are using entire spectrum band now,1533476143
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,So either you need multiple beacons or a fast processor which can run thru,1533476158
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,Yes and the other way is to use Car CAN OBD.. (iirc they're also connected to the receiver),1533476256
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,Nah bad idea,1533476305
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,No no not anymore,1533476307
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,They are isolated from CAN bus😅,1533476317
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,Haa,1533476320
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,CAN & LIN are going to be replaced with ethernet in cominh future,1533476348
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,Oof..,1533476406
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Infact every semi conductor company making chips for automotive are already doing RnD on making ethernet fit for it,1533476453
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,CAN is not keeping up with bandwidth pace,1533476469
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,And number of lines of code and data transmission will surpass what’s there on a plane soon enough😛,1533476494

Setu,Gupta,SetuGupta,Win 10 everybody,1534088955
Setu,Gupta,SetuGupta,You have become the very thing you were supposed to destroy,1534089027
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,There's a couple of mouser group purchase companies as well. It would be cool if someone did a guide to Lajpat Rai so you can avoid all the stores that scam school/college students,1534089853
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,+1 that’s on my to-do list🙂 soon!,1534089884
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Bdw shop 595 bonus is my go-to,1534089904
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,So it's been a while. Was 595 the guy whose store burned down like 2 years ago? He used to keep a bunch of kit ready stuff?,1534089971
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Not sure! It’s bonus electronics,1534090007
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,Oh yeah. That's the guy.,1534090016
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,He's one of the guys that overcharges school and college students,1534090037
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Everybody exploits newbies there!,1534090080
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,If you know things they won’t!,1534090091
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,True that. I never found well pricedngood quality battery connectors or mounts and plastics no matter how many stores I found,1534090153
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,*looked in,1534090160
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,I see,1534090187
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,Though 400 INR/m of those adafruit smartleds was nice,1534090215
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Neopixels?,1534090229
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,They don’t know this name,1534090236
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,5050 LED is common name afaik,1534090245
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,5050 refers to the size.,1534090360
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,So there if you say magic lights you'll get the shift register strips,1534090376
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,But if you mention 2812 or ws2812 or smartleds they'll give you neopixel strips,1534090402
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,I think it was shop number 199 or 200 or something around there.,1534090416
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,i never had luck by saying ws821x,1534090459
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,Actually I have a bunch of electronics stuff that I just never use anymore since the Delhi maker's asylum shut down.,1534090525
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,Most is trash but I have a few LED strips and some si labs gecko boards.,1534090548
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,If people here will use em I can give em to you,1534090559
Piyush,Malhotra,Piyushmalhotra,"I was looking of this a month ago, they were out of stock on gearbest, so visited lajpat rai,

Tried many shops but none recognize them by it's name.
If you guys know any particular shop this do let me know.( Od even any substitue)
Thanks.",1534090565
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,try saying 5050 RGB LEDs,1534090619
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,if you've neopixel LED strip I'll happily put them to good use...,1534090648
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,Yeah sure. Will dig em out tomorrow evening and hand em off sometime.,1534090681
Piyush,Malhotra,Piyushmalhotra,At last a shopkeeper at 583 shop number offered a 5050 led strip which was 5m in length and costed 1.1k INR. Any cheeper option?,1534090710
Ayan,Pahwa,cli_ninja,Try fab.to.lab online store,1534090745
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,So cheapest I got was 400/m for really low leds/m. On average 800 or so was decent,1534090776
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,Also look out for Chinese shopping holidays singles day is a big one. You can get a ton of components really cheap from stuff like AliExpress if you're ok waiting a bit,1534090849
Piyush,Malhotra,Piyushmalhotra,Can I DM you ?,1534090998

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Does anyone know what's the difference between sudo sh -c and  sudo -- sh -c,1534150070
Rahul,Bansal,GypsyCosmonaut,What is sudo --,1534151639
Rahul,Bansal,GypsyCosmonaut,From man page,1534151726
Rahul,Bansal,GypsyCosmonaut,The -- indicates that sudo should stop processing commands line arguments,1534151755
Rahul,Bansal,GypsyCosmonaut,But it complicated the question for me,1534151814
Rahul,Bansal,GypsyCosmonaut,Okay got it,1534151960
Rahul,Bansal,GypsyCosmonaut,Try sudo -- --help,1534151985
Rahul,Bansal,GypsyCosmonaut,Then try sudo --help --,1534152006
Rahul,Bansal,GypsyCosmonaut,So in sudo sh -c 'ls' you're saying execute ls in sh shell as root user (sudo),1534152129
Rahul,Bansal,GypsyCosmonaut,"sudo -- sh -c 'ls' also does the same thing, your just telling sudo to not process any other flags for sudo when you're saying --",1534152216

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Hehe :D,1534186218
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Which GPU (AMD or Nvidia) would you guys recommend if I want to go into GPU programming?,1534186262
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,Amd,1534186272
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Why?,1534186277
Sandeep,Kr,,Anything specific you want to do with GPUs?,1534186441
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Something like scientific programming,1534186455
cocoa,,cocoa1231,That's as specific I can get right now. Haven't decided much after that,1534186473
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But I do want to get into scientific computing,1534186485
Sandeep,Kr,,A lot of times GPUs are used for training/accelerating neural networks,1534186490
Sandeep,Kr,,Nvidia,1534186502
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Why Nvidia's CUDA over an open standard like openCL?,1534186534
Sandeep,Kr,,Good question,1534186557
Sandeep,Kr,,Good support for tensorflow,1534186575
Sandeep,Kr,,That is the primary reason,1534186585
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Hm. Okay. Thanks a lot for the recommendation :D

 I'll look into it a bit more.",1534186639
Sandeep,Kr,,For doing opencl and opengl coding you can even use your Intel's integrated graphic card AKA poorman's opencl exploration,1534186714

Yash,Anand,deathwalker007,Nvidia is much better than amd...,1534187455
Yash,Anand,deathwalker007,And has some heating issue,1534187467
Piyush,Malhotra,Piyushmalhotra,"If you are setting up a desktop, get AMD with proper cooling, 
Else if you are buying a laptop, I would recommend Nvidia",1534189051
Aakash,Saini,,"Pls explain why? Technically! 
..& Not diplomatically.",1534218501
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,"Cuda is a lot more popular than openCL. Mostly cuz Nvidia has done a ton of work on making sure its gets adopted by optimizing a whole bunch of math - mostly linear algebra and things like that which makes the ecosystem a lot nicer to work in.  Plus if Im not wrong you can write OpenCL for Nvidia cards as well, whereas the reverse isn't true. Also this is purely speculative and I have no data to back it up, but IMO amd cards were hit a lot harder by crypto mining inflation than nvidia.",1534223930
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,"also make sure that even in Nvidia your card supports the CUDA version you want - I'm not very recent, but I remember a couple of years ago I was putting together a AR thing and needed a CUDA version that was only on a gtx9xx or higher.",1534224073

@cocoa1231, can you take this up after your exams? Maybe on 30th September?
CC: @shivanib, @sakshi04?",1535971789

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yup. I'm up for it,1535971831
cocoa,,cocoa1231,And we got a month to plan and do it right,1535971839
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Yes.
I'll have a venue arranged.",1535971876
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,"Given the very less participation of women in the recent meetups, I was thinking of hosting a webinar. What do you all think?
There will be more women for sure. I can also talk to some international women speakers to join in",1535971892
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,Awesome.,1535971902
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Oh yeah, I like that. That way people don't have to go out of their way too much to get a loose introduction to the community",1535971943
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Maybe we can try to hold a webinar every week we don't have a meetup,1535971979
cocoa,,cocoa1231,So alternate between a webinar and an actual meetup,1535971991
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Sounds good to me!
We can have this on alternate weekends, too.",1535972011
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Haha, yess. I wanted to ask/say the same thing :P",1535972047
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,Fine. We don't even need a Sunday for a webinar. But a time suitable for everyone. Maybe 8 or 9 PM,1535972235

We need to revive it, too.",1535972846
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,Saturdays?,1535972852
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I was thinking some weekday so that it doesn't overlap with the meetup and we can to it at night as @shivanib suggested,1535972883
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"No stress about Friday.
No tension about Monday :P",1535972889

But what about those who are working? Tiring, plus some stuff to look after once they're home na? Not sure about that.",1535972961

Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"In simpler terms,
Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a distributed system in order to build confidence in the system’s capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production. :P

P.S. I heartily request you to attend the next meetup and do a hands-on :D",1535973083
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Sure.
@sakshi04, please tweet regarding the same? 🙈",1535973104

Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"As per @cocoa1231, 
Basic idea is, the people conducting the workshop come up with way to break the system that would require you learn something new while fixing it, and guide you through the process of it. Nudging you in the right direction.",1535973181
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,Awesome! :D,1535973194
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,"I see. So basically, break the system in different ways, and then try to make it work normally again.",1535973232
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,When did the 1st happen?,1535973237
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Precisely.
Poking the system :P",1535973293

Apurv,,ajyotirmay,"One thing I didn't like about this platform, is that there's no way of telling what kind of content am I going go consume.
What I mean by this is, to sed what courses are available on your platform, an user needs to create an account. I'm personally not a fan of this approach. What you could/can do is let the user search for courses and browse your catalog to see if what he/she is looking for, is available there. Then the user can decide if they want to signup to enroll themselves in your course or not.

Other than that, I think this business is a neat idea that has proven to work. All the best with it :)",1537452390

Hello Saikat 👋🏼, nice to meet you!
I'm Group Butler, the first administration bot using the official Bot API.

I can do a lot of cool stuffs, here's a short list:
• I can kick or ban users
• You can use me to set the group rules
• I have a flexible anti-flood system
• I can welcome new users with a customizable message, or if you want with a gif or a sticker
• I can warn users, and ban them when they reach the maximum number of warnings
• I can also warn, kick or ban users when they post a specific media
…and more, below you can find the ""all commands"" button to get the whole list!

I work better if you add me to the group administrators (otherwise I won't be able to kick or ban)!",1537553719

1. Services & Daemon - starting, stopping, finding logs.
2. Tweaking GUI using config files and not by installing tweak tools.
3. Download files Linux ways using curl, whether & youtube-dl.
4. write, compile, run, debug any basic code in C / C++ / Java / Python / Perl on Linux , to have an idea of programming in Linux environment.
5. Using Gparted.
6. Understand every bit of what top command gives you.
7. Use cron to automate your script.
8. Write some basic bash scripts to do stuffs.
9. Learn some cool and advanced usage of grep, sed, ask, cut.
10. Configuring a network interface.
11. Using tty
12. Learn about filesystem - config files, boot files, use files and others 
13. Using mkfs.ext4
14. Finding everything using netstat",1537597340

Kuntal,M,hellozee,"@ajyotirmay 
There are around 10k seats currently in IITs, almost 9.5k gets filled up. 
Why the rest don't opt for it? Because they didn't get CSE/ECE/Mech.
Every year the JEE toppers say to media that Computer Science is their passion. Then why the f*** were you solving MCQs in Bansal Classes?
Most of the students just get into IIT for the tag. And the dream that he/she would be the CEO of a Fortune 200 company. Even he/she has zero interest in studying that stuff.
Earlier JEE papers were set in way, that it can only be solved with sheer intelligence but now you got to rub your a** inside any of the premium coaching institutes for a year or two to clear JEE Advance.
And the ever increasing number of IITs will only add to the number of idiots it produced, compared to the smart people.
May have missed a couple of points, but this should do it",1537719113

VogonPoet,,vogonpoet,When did the pattern change and how did it affect the ratio of smart people and idiots?,1537719982
VogonPoet,,vogonpoet,"I'm not saying everyone studying in an IIT is smart af but you seem to think everything they do is only for the ""tag"".

Well no, it is quite literally the premier institution for higher studies. Millions of people aspire to get into one not so they could get a tag but because they aspire for good quality education just like anyone else would",1537720089
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"Just look at their papers from 90s, they could be solved by just sheer intelligence plus there were no coaching centers hence genuine students, it was not a rat race then, but now it is",1537720093

Philomath,,miphilomath,"Oh yes!

The laptop works fine for me and cost me only 25k",1537720592
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,"You can get good specs for Acer. Asus will cost you a little more than Acer laptops. The only issue I've seen with Acers is the quality of plastic that they use. Try to spend more on CPU, and make sure that there is an extra RAM slot. That's going to be cheap.",1537721200
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,"Okay, I share the same opinion as yours. I am totally against the education our system has been delivering for all this time. But, that doesn't mean you can't take benefit of something they are organizing. And I do hate people who pretend to ""love"" computer science when they don't evem enjoy it. But hey, I can't do much about it. That's just the way our society is. More than ideas and innovations, we prefer to talk about who the CEO of that big MNC is, or how much money someone's making. And that's why I like some of the American universities, because they promote working on ideas and turning them profitable. Unlike our institutions which solely focus on getting good placement results.",1537721474
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,"He didn't mean everyone, but yeah, most of them are. Engineering isn't about cramming  stuff and vomiting it on sheets. Engineering is about creating solutions, and knowledge is just a tool for that, plus you do need to have that intelligence or passion to create solutions, otherwise one will end up just implementing what others are creating. So it isn't really a case of sour grapes. I never tried for IITs, because I couldn't resonate with this idea of JEE. Those exams are meant for schools students, but you need to attend special classes to be able to leave an impression? I don't appreciate it. And if I had put my heart in it, I'd have gotten one. But I didn't want to do that. And we do need to change this, or at least be vocal enough to ask for a change in this.",1537721749

nly,,muhfreedom,Check /etc/fstab maybe you mounted the filesystem as read-only when it should be rw.,1537726467
nly,,muhfreedom,Unmount filesystem and run fsck on it also helps,1537726507
Raman,Tehlan,ramantehlan,"This is a file corruption issue, so if OS sense something wrong with the file system, it makes it read-only, and when it restarts, OS try to fix, if it is successful, all is good, other wise you get stuck with a read only system, most probably it won't even boot now. 

You will need to live boot and try running fsck.",1537726567

Shivank,Gautam,shivank98,i was sort of proud my name is unique,1537816522
Shivank,Gautam,shivank98,"try upgrade.
recently had same problem",1537816537
‌शिवाnk,,shivankchoudhary,Did that too.,1537816574
‌शिवाnk,,shivankchoudhary,I am having Ubuntu 18.04,1537816620
‌शिवाnk,,shivankchoudhary,😂,1537816668
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,TBH that's more of a nic thing than a TCS thing,1537836616
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Um. What is that in the middle of i3status's manpage?,1537851308
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I swear I'm not making this up,1537851308
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I was just scrolling and it showed up,1537851308

Kuntal,M,hellozee,same font,1537852790
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yeah. So wouldn't be a font issue. What else,1537852811
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,how?,1537866643
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,Well typically the NIC would work with the government department that needs the website - draft the requirements approve the solutions and set up maintenance. TCS like any service company is fully capable of writing proper CSS and media queries - but they'll write as little as they can get away with before moving onto the next project,1537866943
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,you mean they can write css but not center their HTML?,1537866987
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,margin : auto;,1537866995
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,Which is css btw.,1537867099
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,and they can't write that,1537867121
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,What? That's a bit of a stretch,1537867153
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,I mean they could have just written margin : auto; which they didnt. if they did that website at the least would have been centered,1537867192
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,Sure but probably the UAT was done on a fixed set of resolutions. So as long as it looks fine on those they wouldn't bother.,1537867282
‌शिवाnk,,shivankchoudhary,I think tcs doesn't handle cbse website.,1537868231
Aakash,Saini,,NIC. National Informatics Center. It’s government internet wing.,1537869474
Aakash,Saini,,nic.gov.in,1537869497

Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,,1537876121
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Please introduce yourself, @Prat009",1537876144
Aakash,Saini,,what topic/section you are expecting?,1537877437
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,Anything. Would love to have a talk on anything.,1537877489
Aakash,Saini,,Ok. Let me know in advance when you plan around noida.,1537877674
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,Definitely :D,1537877701
Aakash,Saini,,👍 will plan something very useful to you all.,1537877766
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,Would you mind if I DM you?,1537877845
Aakash,Saini,,Ok,1537877865
Aakash,Saini,,"BTW, you didn’t solve this tweak👍",1537877996

Banana,,nihilist_banana,+1,1537884488
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,,1537889623
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Guys whats up?,1537889633
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Please introduce yourself, @Minraws.",1537889634
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"All good, aap batao?",1537889643
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,"Nice, Was busy with some problems, Aabhi bhi hun but thora free hun",1537889676
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Back to work,1537889678
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,Awesome! :D,1537889690
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Aur koi interesting topic if discussed?,1537889715
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,How about taking a talk on Debian Packaging?,1537889823
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,A hands-on?,1537889833
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,I am a budding programmer with great love for FOSS and Linux. ;),1537889883
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,"Well i would love to give, But no one is interested plus shown up audience is really less and to be true to start packaging u must have a good grip of basics of cli as all the wprks are done in cli",1537890142
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,I see a couple of people interested. And shouldn't that be enough? :/,1537890253
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Alrighty.
Take one for having a ""good grip of basics of CLI""?",1537890285
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,"Yeah even if 2 people do it till the end, Thats enough",1537890365
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,"Maybe i am not the right guy, because i can't explain and many things which i do is i google ot and catch it and try it, So i think u should take it as u are well aware with basocs cli command",1537890409
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,How about having it simultaneously?,1537890500
nly,,muhfreedom,"There is one CLI shortcut, you can use C-p and C-n to go through history (at least in gnome terminal)",1537890519
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Also, I've been facing a lil' difficulty in packaging, too.",1537890532
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Not even packaging, just the Docker part^^",1537890549
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Tell it here maybe i can help although i dont have laptop with me its broken still,1537890561
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Say it,1537890564
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Typing history works, too? :P",1537890574
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Up and down arrows keys do the same,1537890584
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,"In cinnamon too, But u must at least remember the starting one and have used it",1537890588
nly,,muhfreedom,But then you have to move your hand from the home row,1537890611
nly,,muhfreedom,Also C-a(ctrl-a) goes to front of the line,1537890640
nly,,muhfreedom,C-e for line end,1537890654
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Just how fast do you plan on typing.,1537890658
nly,,muhfreedom,"Haha, I just get by :P",1537890682
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,And I did then rather only use Emacs and not even bother with anything else.,1537890691
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,I mean no GUI cause you know mouse is soo slow.,1537890715
nly,,muhfreedom,That's a great idea! :) I use terminal inside emacs lel,1537890751
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Tried that been there but I like my GUI.,1537890804
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Tell brother,1537890806
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,@rajudev^,1537890843
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,,1537890873
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,How's this PDF to follow?,1537890885
nly,,muhfreedom,Do you fany lisp machines? Emacs is sort of a lisp machine :P,1537890889
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Lisp machine?? I think that was something to do with hardware.,1537890972
nly,,muhfreedom,Yeah those ones,1537891005
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Emacs is hardware??,1537891024
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,@reflect0r^^,1537891026
nly,,muhfreedom,The idea is to have a whole os modifiable at runtime,1537891028
nly,,muhfreedom,Emacs is sort of a lisp machine simulator :P,1537891059
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,"Well just do, sudo docker pull debian:sid",1537891073
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"Oh the ideology part, yeah. That's interesting.",1537891076
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,But I like vim and it's simplicity more.,1537891097
nly,,muhfreedom,Sure whatever you fancy :),1537891121
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"Cause it's no OS, and I want a text editor",1537891127
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,But my favourite really is VS Code.,1537891146
nly,,muhfreedom,Ooo,1537891159
nly,,muhfreedom,How's that?,1537891165
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,I might hate Microsoft but I love that beast,1537891170
nly,,muhfreedom,"I've tried vim, its hard to use :P",1537891187
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,It's IDE but can run on weak laptops and desktops with ease,1537891189
nly,,muhfreedom,Nice,1537891195
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,How? You really need to try it more.,1537891205
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,Yeah. Using sudo everytime it throws me an error.,1537891209
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Everything makes soo much sense there,1537891214
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Nowadays I can find new commands just from common sense,1537891227
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,And it feels soo awesome,1537891234
nly,,muhfreedom,Nice,1537891240
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,How do I upgdate/upgrade then? :/,1537891244
nly,,muhfreedom,Like?,1537891252
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Can i see the error?,1537891253
nly,,muhfreedom,"I can navigate in vim, exec shell etc",1537891272
nly,,muhfreedom,Basics,1537891286
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,U have to get in the container,1537891296
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Haan, haan. Just posting the error once again. Gimme a moment.",1537891321
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,,1537891333
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,See it says after docker pull debian:sid what to do,1537891352
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,I'm stuck at the update part,1537891462

Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Do this,1537891994
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,deb http://deb.debian.org/debian unstable main?,1537892023
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,He wants to upgrade individual packages or the debian version?,1537892023
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,is your dns inside the container set up?,1537892056
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,like from inside the container are you able to ping a domain vs an ip?,1537892075
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,Yes yes,1537892090
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Yeah,1537892217
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,I'm able to connect to http://cdn-fastly.deb.debian.org/debian sid/main,1537892274
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Yeah one mirror of deb.debian.org,1537892371
karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,so this is a fairly old thread - but I'm assuming you've checked it out? https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/apt-error-temporary-failure-resolving-deb-debian-org,1537892588
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Yes, I did.",1537892871
nly,,muhfreedom,@utkarsh2102 did you manage to make it work?,1537892914
nly,,muhfreedom,Share it if you make it work. Just interested.,1537893001
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Nahh.
Couldn't.",1537893060
nly,,muhfreedom,Share the fix is what I meant,1537893222
nly,,muhfreedom,Ah,1537893233
nly,,muhfreedom,"Even for me, I probably spend much time fixing these sorts of issues rather than doing something useful lol :P",1537893319
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,What i told did u do that,1537893327
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Same here for past 1 year i did this,1537893340
nly,,muhfreedom,Lol,1537893352
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Aakash, I couldn't possibly come up with the expanded form.
Just know:
a = ++i;  // a is set to the result of i+1
a = i++;  // make a copy of i, compute i+1, save the copy of i in a
Which is quite the basic^^
Unfold the mystery?
Also, it it anything related to looking up to the assembly code? I mean, it's not. But will it lead to anything?",1537893407
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Will try in my next attempt :P
Pinged all the communities and googled for around 2 hours. 
Couldn't get anything so gave up packaging altogether :/",1537893467
nly,,muhfreedom,Try that first utkarsh xD,1537893503
Aakash,Saini,,Let me write a small example for you and try run it! I will remove basics from code which you can add yourself! It’s just to avoid typing much in mobile!..,1537893511
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,Sure.,1537893526
nly,,muhfreedom,This will probably fix your issue,1537893556
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,Hopefully :/,1537893581
Aakash,Saini,,"Code:
main() {
int i=0;
printf(“X: %d\n”, i++);
printf(“X: %d\n”, ++i);
}

main() {
int i=0;
printf(“X: %d\n”, i=i+1);
printf(“X: %d\n”, ++i);
}

—— check:output it will be different from above both!!

main() {
int i=0;
printf(“X: %d\n”, i+1);
printf(“X: %d\n”, ++i);
}

Guess why so?!!",1537893720
Aakash,Saini,,"I only suggested 
i++ and not i = i++;
Thought results will be same for both!!",1537893795
Aakash,Saini,,"Answer for 1-2 will be 0,2 whereas for 3 is 1,2😋",1537893854
Aakash,Saini,,It’s nothing mystery! Just little concentration required and you/anyone can solve it.,1537894066
Aakash,Saini,,"It’s just C, when it will come to assembly I will explain, but currently nothing related to asm.",1537894139
nly,,muhfreedom,Oh is it c?,1537894240
Aakash,Saini,,"If I explain the answer, everyone will say “ohhh! No”😋",1537894266
nly,,muhfreedom,"I got 1,1 for 3 in c with gcc",1537894295
nly,,muhfreedom,Though I am really running this in scheme lol,1537894324
Aakash,Saini,,"Yes 1,1sorry typos. I’m on mobile. I didn’t realize it’s i+1",1537894331
Aakash,Saini,,😋,1537894339
Sakshi,Sangwan,sakshi04,"The answers would be
0 1
1 2
1 1
Respectively",1537894397
Sakshi,Sangwan,sakshi04,The logic is pretty simple,1537894421
Aakash,Saini,,"👍but first two it’s 0,2.. check with you compiler patch/updates.",1537894448
Aakash,Saini,,Then explain ++i😋,1537894460
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,Simply an increment without being assigned?,1537894549
Aakash,Saini,,I didn’t get you ! Can you elaborate.,1537894583
Aakash,Saini,,"Don’t answer Code:, answer the tweak #1",1537894617
Sakshi,Sangwan,sakshi04,"Nope, comes 1,2 for second case",1537894690
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,Is it just i+1?,1537894695
Aakash,Saini,,Code is the help you understand what is going on with pre/post increment. If you can catch the 🐟,1537894698
nly,,muhfreedom,"I got 1,2 for 2",1537894706
Aakash,Saini,,Yes simple i+1,1537894717
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Hehe, yeah!
Eureka xD",1537894747
Aakash,Saini,,But this is not answer to ++i,1537894773
nly,,muhfreedom,"Aakash I got 0,2 for 1. 1,2 for 2.",1537894837
Aakash,Saini,,"Give output of this command: $gcc -v
I want to know what compiler you are using!",1537894838
Sakshi,Sangwan,sakshi04,"In the first case 0 is printed and then incremented, and ++i would increment and then print 
Hence
0,2

In second case we are storing the value 0+1 in i hence prints 1
And ++i works the same
Thus
1,2

In third case i+1 is printed i.e 0+1 = 1
But the value of i still is 0
Hence ++i results in 1
Thus
1,1",1537894859

Sakshi,Sangwan,sakshi04,"Gcc 6.3
Using online compiler on phone 😅",1537894896
nly,,muhfreedom,Lol,1537894909
nly,,muhfreedom,"Online compiler, nice",1537894921
Aakash,Saini,,That’s the problem. Not online compilers. Never use online compilers you will end getting wrong results.,1537894930
Aakash,Saini,,Use native Linux/Unix compilers what ever OS you use!,1537894959
Sakshi,Sangwan,sakshi04,But you got the same output 😂,1537894979
nly,,muhfreedom,But I am using Linux compiler,1537894985

Updateeee",1537894996

nly,,muhfreedom,,1537895067
nly,,muhfreedom,"Pardon the ss, I don't have desktop telegram",1537895082
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,That's pretty much explainable.,1537895087
Aakash,Saini,,"Ok! May be I’m wrong somewhere;
Try x=x++ instead of x=x+1",1537895093
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Yeah, that'll give you a value less.",1537895182
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"But a difference of 2 in the next, if you print x.",1537895213
nly,,muhfreedom,But at one point you start learning the compiler instead of the language :P,1537895249
Aakash,Saini,,Yes! That why I as expand ++i,1537895252
Aakash,Saini,,😋👍,1537895266
Banana,,nihilist_banana,I think this is accurate.,1537896854
Aakash,Saini,,"Yes made mistake with
i=i+1 change it to i=i++

Also i+=1 act as i=i+1

Aakash,Saini,,😋are you afraid to put your real name? You may put monkey eating banana as dp! At least name should be good for addressing!,1537897302
Banana,,nihilist_banana,"Majority of the people in college called me Banana. So the name stuck. Also, I noticed that people find it hard to address to me as 'sir' because it doesn't go well with the name. So I prefer it to my real name.",1537897505
Aakash,Saini,,"As you wish! If you are poor in addressing yourself, how will you help your students.",1537897579

The program that I gave was to support #1 as hint to understand.
Changes that I mention is the correction to code that I mentioned with typo mistakes.",1537901228

Voting should be above 75% of total member (as of now (374) in this channel😋",1537901797

Aakash,Saini,,No!,1537901891

vader121,,vader_121,Thanks,1538111111

So in prog the ""if"" statements are capitalized?😅",1538111282

Thanks you pointed the typo corrections. I’ve edited. 

But now find why prog:1 is faulty and prog:2 is correct .",1538111430
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"So the answer lies in the space in the line:
scanf("" %c"",&val);",1538112652
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,Right before %c^,1538112668

Aakash,Saini,,😄,1538112713
Aakash,Saini,,Explain why?,1538112721
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,Adding the space to the format string tells the scanf function to discard all the whitespace characters.,1538112993
Aakash,Saini,,No!,1538113027
Aakash,Saini,,This explanation is mysterious😋..,1538113080

The second scanf? :/",1538113152

Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Yess, yes.",1538113216
Aakash,Saini,,😋👍,1538113229
Aakash,Saini,,I should have avoided the solution. Maybe next time I will not given solutions so as you don’t run diff or map lines 1:1😋,1538113287
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"%d doesn't.
%c does.
Hence adding a space to %c removes all kind of whitespace and special characters. Including the ASCII characters of function keys.",1538113298
Aakash,Saini,,"Yes because %c takes 1 character, and %d string of integers.",1538113345
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"xD
I didn't.
I thought you skipped the space becuase you were typing on the phone :/",1538113361
Aakash,Saini,,Lol😋,1538113372
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"So #2 is solved.
Hoorah! :D",1538113399
Aakash,Saini,,👍but #1 is still unsolved and it’s rather more simpler that #2😜,1538113437
Aakash,Saini,,Explain why printf return LF despite \n is not put at the end??😜,1538113557
Aakash,Saini,,The problem was with printf not scanf😋,1538113605

Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Then the ++b is executed as a separate statement am I correct???,1538145672
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,Yep,1538145771
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,Same thing happens when you assign int.. idk if this is correct or not,1538145854
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,"int a=3;
int b=4;
int c=0;
c=a,b;

This was on some Reddit thread and many devs answered that 'c' will be 4",1538145931
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,But again comma operator plays a role and c is assigned 3,1538145944
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"It should be done like c = ( a, b);",1538146468
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Or else it will be a different statement after c=a at least from how I understand it.,1538146507
Saikat,Ghosh,Saikatghosh,Guys are you collage students or do job,1538146546
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"All types of people are here I think. 

I am first year at college.",1538146621
Saikat,Ghosh,Saikatghosh,Great,1538146655
ajx,,,school,1538146679
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,You are a school student?,1538146726
ajx,,,yep,1538146739
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,School wala here,1538146918
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"@p5g41tmlx 
Oh and I disected the comma feature completely it's pretty interesting.
I knew that JavaScript had it but now I know where they stole it from.",1538147116
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,Lmfao,1538147157
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"Also the way it's useful will be to write better succinct code.
An example will be,

int value = (isSpecial)?(do(), 10):1;

Here we can assign 10 to value and call do() if isSpecial is true.",1538147415
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,"Typical comma operator is like
Run the left part.. if it's a function then don't give a f about the return value.. then run the right part but do care abt the return value if it's a func",1538147535
Aakash,Saini,,You need to understand how common operator is actually used!.,1538148467
Aakash,Saini,,Let me little modify you program & you answer the value!!,1538148541
Aakash,Saini,,"#include<iostream>

int main()
{
int a=10;
int b=15;
bool c=true;

c ? ++a, --b : --a;

In your program I’ve remove ‘++b’.
Only this is removed. Now tell me the output!",1538148594
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,++a and --b,1538148611
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,After this nothing get executed,1538148623
Aakash,Saini,,Rest entire program is same! Only ++b is removed.,1538148634
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,.,1538148651
Aakash,Saini,,What is the output ?,1538148676
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,11 14,1538148723
Aakash,Saini,,"I have only changed one line;
c ? ++a, --b : --a, ++b;
TO
c ? ++a, --b : --a;",1538148746
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,.,1538148755
Aakash,Saini,,Now I will tell your program error!,1538148770
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,Mhm,1538148776
Aakash,Saini,,"changed line;
c ? ++a, --b : --a, ++b;

TO

c ? print(“++A:”), print(“—B:”) : print(“—A:”), print(“++B:”);

Replace ++a/b & —a/b with above statement.

>> You will know why *comma-operator* failed you!!",1538148994
Aakash,Saini,,"I suppose you very well understand  that “ ?: “ is conditional operator! And how to use it!

C (1) ? TRUE : FALSE",1538149081
Aakash,Saini,,"In your case
C(1) ? True, True : False, True",1538149123
Aakash,Saini,,"The last should be False,False!",1538149144
Aakash,Saini,,😋,1538149146
Aakash,Saini,,Use printf & include #stdio.h,1538149198
Aakash,Saini,,I’m using mobile! To so correct basics yourself. It’s problematic on iPhone autocorrection.,1538149233
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,"Acc to you
c? ++a, ++b: --a, --b;

Will output ++a nd ++b.. yep?",1538149239
Aakash,Saini,,Wait ! Let me fix your code.,1538149267
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,Mhm,1538149271

drakula,,p5g41tmlx,Oh.. just lemme try it again,1538150006
Aakash,Saini,,"That’s why it’s making 15
Because ++a:11, —b:14, —a:not-executed, ++b:it-makes-it-15",1538150040
Aakash,Saini,,Ok,1538150049
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,"++a,--b:++a,--b

So acc to you.. in this ^ case ++a,--b and then ++a again will be executed.. yeap?",1538150228
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,--b at the end will be executed as a separate statement.,1538150288
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,Ik This and that too bcz of order of precedence,1538150308
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,"That case will be executed as two statements acc to me
(c?(++a, --b:++a)), --b",1538150384
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,First ternary operator will be executed and then --b,1538150415
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"Yes that's correct, here comma acts as a separator",1538150422
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,Yes,1538150429
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,And sirf ese hi poocha idhar.. i thought some may learn a new thing... Yaa mujhe kuch naya pata chle,1538150469
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"@p5g41tmlx now a very simple question(s) for you,

What will a be in,

Q1:
int a = 1,2,3;

Q2:
a = 1,2,3;",1538150739
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,It's really fun to fiddle with these things. 😁😝😜,1538150776
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,"1. Error.
2. I'm sorry.. kya?",1538150851
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,1. I'm pretty sure.. error aaega,1538150877
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"at the end of Q1 error that's correct, it was a trick question.",1538151000
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,And the second one compiles,1538151007
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,If a is already declared as an int,1538151017
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,I didn't get that second thing,1538151023
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,It's answer will be 1.,1538151035
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,Ohh ese bolo fir,1538151036
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,"Nah I legit thought you just meant declare ""a"" like that",1538151059
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,Kind of confused so answer nhi kia,1538151073
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Oh. 😜,1538151092
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Sorry for the confusion,1538151102
Animesh,Verma,AniVerma17,Sorry I was away for long... What's happening here guys?,1538151553
Aakash,Saini,,You need to use conditional operator correctly.,1538151975
Aakash,Saini,,"#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
int a, b, c=1;

a=10; b=15;
c ? ++a, --b : --a, ++b;

}",1538152194
Aakash,Saini,,Run & see output and find where your code was problematic.,1538152217
Aakash,Saini,,"Use comman-operator properly, else it will break your code!",1538152239
Aakash,Saini,,Comma operator can break your code! Code properly with parenthesis when needed.,1538152405
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Can u all paste code at paste pad and share the link please,1538153028
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,@admins please book mark it for a moment about the paste pad,1538153046
Manas,kashyap,reflect0r,Paste.debian.net,1538153050
Aakash,Saini,,Hmmm.. okay! But it’s double work!,1538153121
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yes but that way the code can keep it's formatting and not clutter up the chat,1538199583

Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,"Mistake 1 ) our school started using ubuntu in our computers. 
This gave a jab to the kids out of nowhere 2nd graders were forced to migrate onto an enviorment they had never used or heard of.
Mistake 2 ) They never updated the computers

Mistake 3) The teachers never really did a good job of telling students why using Linux is good for them in the long run.",1538234451

Kuntal,M,hellozee,"When did 2nd graders are expected to even know an environment before hand?
14.04 should be okay, it is supported till 2019
Why did you left it to the teachers? They are getting paid for what they are doing currently why should they waste their energy? Personally I made sure that once I convinced the Principal, each and every pc in the whole school is converted to linux, even the office ones",1538234672

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Didn't understand. Elaborate please,1538234719

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Just noticed,1538243136
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I was sleepy at that time,1538243144
Aakash,Saini,,I cannot answer! i is unknown in your above ex.,1538243148
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,I was just answering in his context. I really shouldn't have answered it like that. 😝,1538243162

Kuntal,M,hellozee,"Wow, which topic? Can we take a read? 😜",1538243177
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Wasn't the question that How would you write the pre and post increments in a more standard form?,1538243178
Aakash,Saini,,No!😋,1538243219
vader121,,vader_121,🤔,1538243229

vader121,,vader_121,😋😁😁,1538243259
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"How will you write
++i;
in above expanded format

This isn't the question?",1538243260
vader121,,vader_121,Yups,1538243269
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Am I not understanding the question?,1538243270
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Pre and post increments make a difference when used in some context,1538243293
Aakash,Saini,,Actually I made mistake and gave #2 tweak with solution! I should have left and it would also been wondering query😋,1538243297
Aakash,Saini,,Then!,1538243309
cocoa,,cocoa1231,That's why you can do for (i = 0; i < 40; ++i) and for (i = 0; i < 40; i++),1538243324
vader121,,vader_121,😂😂,1538243325
vader121,,vader_121,Yez,1538243337
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"So asking in isolation what's the expanded form of either, the answer should be they behave the same when alone",1538243366
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"When used in a larger calculation, they behave differently",1538243375
Aakash,Saini,,My tweak #1 is very simple! And straight. Rather it’s even easier than #2,1538243377
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Am I not understanding the question?,1538243396
Aakash,Saini,,Absolutely not!,1538243398

Anjali,,anjalibhavan,Hehehhehehe,1538243657
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"I didn't really research operators before your question so thanks for the push. Haha. 
And what was the tweak #2?",1538243722
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"If I were your teacher, I would be searching for my cane now",1538243736
Aakash,Saini,,Scroll/search backwards for ‘tweaks #2’,1538243766
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"I am good at operators but not good in c++ cause I have only be doing it since past few months on my own.

I did Java in school and C# for game development.",1538243813
Aakash,Saini,,😋,1538243817
Aakash,Saini,,Try make c++ = i++ you will learn operators well😋,1538243888
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Okay, Imma solve this like how I solve all my problems when languages behave weird. Imma look at the stack :P",1538243915
cocoa,,cocoa1231,See you tomorrow,1538243918
Kuntal,M,hellozee,You don't need to be good at operators to write nice code,1538243921
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Technically speaking yes C++ is hard but that is beacause you are a spoilt kid,1538243955
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"most of us are, hush",1538243994
🅱️hupesh,Varshney 👨🏽‍💻,Bhuups,😂😂😂😂🤣,1538244044
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"C++ isn't hard I have written basic renders and libraries and lot of stuff in C++ even worked on some big FOSS projects.

Pradhvan,Bisht,Pradhvan,🙌,1538244081
Aakash,Saini,,Did you work on templates,1538244081

Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Godot Game Engine.,1538244127
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Ahhh,1538244133
Kuntal,M,hellozee,you told me last day,1538244138
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Also Blender but that's C,1538244155
Kuntal,M,hellozee,cool,1538244162
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,And Python,1538244165
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,😝,1538244171
Animesh,Verma,AniVerma17,It's mostly Python.,1538244201
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Who told you that all of Blender is C the Python API is for just add-ons and extra stuff,1538244233
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,And it's a separate API implementation,1538244258
VogonPoet,,vogonpoet,Woah! SSCI is top notch! Congratulations!😃,1538244284
Anjali,,anjalibhavan,Thank you! How do you know about SSCI tho? 🙈 Do you present papers as well?,1538244371
Animesh,Verma,AniVerma17,"Maybe, I read some of its core code years ago, most was Python.",1538244439
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,It's core code? You must have read the Python API likely. Or the CPython.,1538244478
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,And yes CPython is a thing,1538244488
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Also called Cython.,1538244496
VogonPoet,,vogonpoet,I have worked on a paper of my own. SSCI is fucking awesome! Many congratulations!,1538244498
Anjali,,anjalibhavan,Whaa that's amaaazing! :'D,1538244527
Anjali,,anjalibhavan,What do you do by the way?,1538244535
Kuntal,M,hellozee,CPython is different from Cython,1538244544
Animesh,Verma,AniVerma17,"It might be the API layer, but definitely wasn't Cython.",1538244561
Kuntal,M,hellozee,It is not cython,1538244577
Anjali,,anjalibhavan,Yes! I'm free in October. I'll pakka come.,1538244587
Animesh,Verma,AniVerma17,"And that was in 2013, I lost track of it now.",1538244608
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Can you assign me a bug? I hate that phabricator interface,1538244610
Kuntal,M,hellozee,or better say point me out to a solvable one,1538244641
VogonPoet,,vogonpoet,Student,1538244698
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Since we are using both of them in isolation, a very simple program which just does i++ and ++i to int i = 12, and the disassembled output is identical.",1538245656
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I do not understand what the difference here is,1538245660
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Sorry, too lazy for pastebin right now",1538245673
cocoa,,cocoa1231,What's the difference between the mov and movl mnemonic?,1538245874
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"You know if you stare at an output long enough, it starts to make some vague sense",1538245900
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Okay, so I do not completely understand this (yet), but when I disassemble it and assign it to some variable, say instead of i++ I do int d = i++, I get the following",1538246005
cocoa,,cocoa1231,,1538246008
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Note they are different. That means that the operators call different opcodes when used in some context, in this case, assignment",1538246025
cocoa,,cocoa1231,When in isolation they behave symmetrically,1538246035
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"I am looking up a lot of stuff right now, will let you know once I understand it properly",1538246060
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Anyone wanna join me on my crazy?,1538246071
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"Well I concur with you, I have even lost an account cause of it. But compared to before phabricator(Fusion forge) it is better. 
But I am probably on the same level as you, I haven't solved anything big minor bug fixes here and there.
Haven't even looked at it since 12th. 😝 Lack of time what can I say.

I have bigger hand on Godot side cause I like game development more 😁.

That too I have only tried my hand at UI bug fixes they are easier. Try them. Probably I can point you to one.",1538246106
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,@cocoa1231 before anything else add a yaml config file that no compile flags bugs me.,1538246186
cocoa,,cocoa1231,What?,1538246204
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Here we see the no compile flags message,1538246235
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I compiled it by gcc test.c -o test -g,1538246254
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,You are using youcompleteme vim correct?,1538246291
cocoa,,cocoa1231,OH!,1538246300
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I was not thinking of compile flags in that context,1538246308
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Got it,1538246309
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yeah I don't have global compile flags,1538246314
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"weirdly when I set a ycm_extra_conf.py, my python autocomplete stopped recognizing externally installed packages",1538246336
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Packages that wern't in the standard python library,1538246345
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"So no autocomplete for numpy, matplotlib, etc",1538246358
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I just use bear make to make a simple compile_commands.json,1538246368
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But I don't need it right now,1538246374
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Really?,1538246375
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yes, super weird",1538246380
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Will discuss this after I finish this tweak. I mean, I'm waiting for Aakash's reply, but Imma dig into the mnemonics that the disassembler printed",1538246417
nly,,muhfreedom,"@cocoa1231 Thnx for sharing, this is interesting :)",1538246522
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Hehe yeah. Simple stuff can be super interesting :),1538246541
nly,,muhfreedom,Can you tell me what those => are ?,1538246591
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I am figuring it out as I go along too :P,1538246604
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Will keep sharing as I learn,1538246609
nly,,muhfreedom,"In here, I was trying to spot a difference",1538246639
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Oh dang!,1538246655
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I didn't notice the lambdas,1538246659
nly,,muhfreedom,The => look like a cursor to me,1538246666
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Oh could be. Lemme check,1538246681
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Okay, so when line 5 executed, the cursor moved to line 5",1538246719
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Stepping and disassembling, it moved to six",1538246733
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yup,1538246733
cocoa,,cocoa1231,It's a cursor,1538246735
nly,,muhfreedom,Can you run a diff to check if the outputs are completely identical?,1538246795
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,I am not gonna pretend that we were discussing a cursor,1538246805
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yes, lemme do that",1538246810
nly,,muhfreedom,Happy hacking! :),1538246812
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Since we ran disassemble /m, it shows the source code along with the disassembler output, and the only difference is the source code. No difference in the disassembly output :P",1538246985
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Lemme run without /m to cross check,1538247003
cocoa,,cocoa1231,No diff,1538247066
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"Isn't it add then move to the register for i and then to the register for d?
For i++.",1538247083
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Nono, we're checking for output of diff when we don't do any assignment to d",1538247122
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"That's what I was trying to say above. When used in isolation, i.e, not along with anything, ++i and i++ behave the same",1538247143
cocoa,,cocoa1231,The disassembly would look different if we had assigned it to something like d,1538247158
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"That's not right way to do it, most modern compilers will just keep it the same.

Compilers do too much optimizations.

So minor details are just lost.",1538247217
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Hm. How should I go about digging the guts of this then?,1538247239
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,They will process ++i and i++ the same cause they know it's not gonna matter,1538247260
nly,,muhfreedom,That's cool,1538247280
cocoa,,cocoa1231,How old of an compiler would I need to see a difference?,1538247299
nly,,muhfreedom,I don't see why ++I should be different from I++ if this is all there is in the line,1538247320
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"Dunno, I am not old enough to know that. 😜",1538247328
cocoa,,cocoa1231,:P,1538247332
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yes, I was saying the same",1538247344
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Why would there be a differenece if the pre/post increment operators are defined when unsed under some context, like assignment",1538247374
nly,,muhfreedom,Cool find,1538247446
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Hold on,1538247454
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I might be wrong,1538247456

Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,It's a very basic optimization I was shocked to see the how powerful optimizations the compiler performs.,1538247586
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Okay. Now I have install a super old compiler on my to-do list,1538247604
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,There was a post about all this I read somewhere.,1538247611
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Let me search for it.,1538247622
Animesh,Verma,AniVerma17,"One difference is that, in post-increment an additional copy of variable is created to return the initial value before incrementing.
But of course, modern compilers optimize the code, so it's not obvious.",1538247710
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"I couldn't find the one, but this one seems good.
 https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn904673.aspx",1538247724
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"Also disclaimer it's not for the weak minds, it will real tax your mind reading all this in one go. 🤯",1538247808
nly,,muhfreedom,Looks like that's what's happening @AniVerma17,1538248256
Animesh,Verma,AniVerma17,Yeah I saw that,1538248294
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"The main problem is the high instructions count, there are instructions for soo many things and each one more complex than the other. sigh",1538248360
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,This is a big reason. Why I am not a fan of x86,1538248393
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,But ARM is soo much better. For such stuff,1538248413
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Also this is the reason why the compilers for Android and mobiles aren't good enough.,1538248436
Animesh,Verma,AniVerma17,Well most of the Android devices are ARM-based,1538248548
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,That's the point ARM has reduced instruction set and so making compilers for it is harder,1538248589
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,And thus has bugs,1538248595
Animesh,Verma,AniVerma17,Also because Android has very different runtime env,1538248657
Animesh,Verma,AniVerma17,Even the Linux kernel used in it is a modified version,1538248696
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"True. But dissecting a android compiler is a good exercise when I think about it.

Might do it if I have some free time.",1538248892

I'm definitely adding these to LCI's Code of Conduct apart from the other things. Let's make a polite, nice and friendly environment for all those who are beginning.

Making fun of them, telling them how stupid they are, or LMGTFY should absolutely be banned. It can hurt any beginner's sentiments at so many levels. I know so many people who don't join communities online and offline because of such behavior.

This way, people who are willing to contribute can get a kick start and others get a lovely environment and atmosphere to work in.

karmanya,aggarwal,calmdownkarm,What are the downsides of doing a virtual sprint? Have everyone join a large gitter or slack or something - let them chit chat while they work and set up individual sub channels if a lot of people are working on the same projects consecutively. Organize community calls every couple of hours for people to show off their work/talk about the projects they're contributing to.,1538437791
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"A virtual sprint can be of many types and done in many ways, some sprints require you to work on a specific project and in them everyone is on the same group.

But there can be multiple projects and then people are on different groups and so on.

Devsprints usually don't define a way of communication but rather only topics and sometimes not even that.

It's been a while since I have taken part or hosted one but that's the gist of it.",1538447464
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,And nope you don't communicate as much on bigger project with huge groups that's a pain.,1538447553
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,But rather the big guys or the experienced people have a channel where they discuss stuff to make major decisions and the newbies message or call one or more of these guys for help.,1538447624
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,And yes you can setup a central group channel or server for a group but it is not essential.,1538447699

Anything being shared here is not personal, people from this community meet and interact with each other to share knowledge, take help, work on ideas or maybe just to randomly hang around.

Also, this group has been drop dead silent and well that didn't do any good apart from having a really low number of attendees.

Being a girl, I know it is a lot more tougher to put out your thoughts or ask questions in a way too formal group. Keeping the mood light, helpful and following our motto does make people feel welcomed.

Also, it is not only in the group, we tend to keep our meetups the same way.

Apart from that the people active here are also the ones who help out anyone who comes up with any sort of problem.

Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,So it's just like Java.,1538503384
Philomath,,miphilomath,+1,1538503748
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Ahh whut?,1538507515
Kuntal,M,hellozee,From when does having a garbage collector makes something like Java?,1538507546
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"It comes with everything, a cross-compiler too, which can almost compile for anything present in the planet",1538507625
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Is there a smaller package? Because you often don't need that for runtime,1538507871
Kuntal,M,hellozee,the stuff compiled with go can even run without libc,1538507898
Kuntal,M,hellozee,so you basically need go when you want to compile something,1538507912
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Ah so yay must need it go be compiled,1538507928
Kuntal,M,hellozee,oh yup,1538507935
cocoa,,cocoa1231,There should be a yay-bin package,1538507938
Kuntal,M,hellozee,it is written in it,1538507938
Kuntal,M,hellozee,PS : I just did an arch install and installed yay in it,1538507960
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Sweet,1538507975
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Not just the GC but also the compiler it's all alot like Java highly portable that's being able to compile for any platform all these features really bring it closer to Java.,1538508118
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,And afaik it's GC is also similar to Java. Not sure about this haven't read into Go as much.,1538508156
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"Does Java have Pointers?
Does Go have Classes? 
Go's garbage collection is whole lot of different than Java's",1538509142
Kuntal,M,hellozee,http://golang.org/doc/faq#garbage_collection,1538509401
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"Java has reference same as pointers almost and classes or no classes doesn't matter 
Garbage Collection is clearing of data that has no use at scope end.",1538510047
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,And it's down during a pause called GC pause,1538510073
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,This when the code stops execution and manages memory.,1538510104
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,This is usually not a problem in usual applications but in Game or low level high performance systems it's not a good thing.,1538510143
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"Now I remembered why I never did do a dive deep into Go.

Those definitions and reasonings are absurd and down right misleading.",1538510330
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,The seems like I was sort of wrong the GC in Go is more similar to C# than Java.,1538510623
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"It's the Mark and Sweep GC implementation. Which is closer to RC too, so it is supposedly faster.",1538510699
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Also @hellozee Go doesn't have any pointer arithmetic so it's closer to a reference than a pointer from C.,1538510936
Kuntal,M,hellozee,actually you can do but it is not advised to,1538511164
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"Really, then it goes to prove my point that the docs are wrong and misleading.",1538511204
Kuntal,M,hellozee,not exactly c like pointer arithmetic,1538511266
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"At least tell me I can do what I want.So that I know what to do when I have no options.

And why is pointer arithmetic not advised?",1538511283
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Oh ok..,1538511294
Kuntal,M,hellozee,why? do you remember seg faults?,1538511345
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Point but then why not just remove the ability. Like they say.,1538511384
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Cause removing it made more sense,1538511395
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"everything needs a spice, 😜",1538511427
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,True,1538511440
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,The tutorial on Go site is as worthless as a tutorial can be,1538511471
Kuntal,M,hellozee,https://golang.org/pkg/unsafe,1538511512
Kuntal,M,hellozee,i found the package,1538511520
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"The more I see that site the more I hate it.
Still I like Go language overall.",1538511538
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,It's obvious that they have added this unsafe stuff just to say that this is good and this is Bad.,1538511675
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"Is there anything in Go for Asynchronous programming???
@hellozee bhaiya",1538511823

Yash,Anand,deathwalker007,I am unable to update my kali,1538588040
Yash,Anand,deathwalker007,I tried googling but didn't find any thing working,1538588060
Yash,Anand,deathwalker007,Anyone? Please,1538588073
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,sudo?,1538588094
Yash,Anand,deathwalker007,I am  root,1538588107
Yash,Anand,deathwalker007,So no need of sudo,1538588113
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Yeah didn't see that part,1538588123
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,It's sort of at the edge of the image,1538588135
Yash,Anand,deathwalker007,Np,1538588145
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Seems like it is,1538588272
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Lastly make sure you are connected to internet properly,1538588319
Yash,Anand,deathwalker007,connected,1538588393
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Better suggestion : dump kali and switch to some other user oriented distros,1538589624
Saikat,Ghosh,Saikatghosh,I guess there is some problem with the repository...last night i faced the same issue,1538589625
Yash,Anand,deathwalker007,which one ..??,1538589661
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Ubuntu/Linux Mint,1538589670
Saikat,Ghosh,Saikatghosh,Kali is very slow in terms of updating,1538589672
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Ubuntu,1538589680
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Or Elementary,1538589695
Yash,Anand,deathwalker007,but i need like there is lot of tools which i need,1538589697
Yash,Anand,deathwalker007,i try to install msf in ubuntu but it is not working fine,1538589712
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Then arch up,1538589723
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,Msf works just fine in Ubuntu,1538589732
Yash,Anand,deathwalker007,,1538589738
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,Arch linux,1538589748
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Both Kali and Ubuntu are Debian based so that should not happen,1538589754
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"First rule of using kali, you can ask questions that way",1538589768
Yash,Anand,deathwalker007,ok i will try that,1538589773
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,If you need something for pentesting then move to parrotsec or black arch,1538589798
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,What's msf?,1538589831
Yash,Anand,deathwalker007,metasploit,1538589848
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,Metasploit.. it's like a bag of pre written scripts a attacker can use to attack,1538589854
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,A big bag tbh,1538589873
Yash,Anand,deathwalker007,ok,1538589883
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"How does msf relate to meta sploit.

Ok nvm.
I have installed metasploit on Ubuntu works for me.",1538589917
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Haven't used it much though.,1538589925
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,😁😜,1538589938
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,MetaSploitFramework,1538589956
drakula,,p5g41tmlx,MSF,1538589958
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Ok git repo name fine I concede,1538589998
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Even though I might be young I have sort of an inability to guess these acronyms,1538590045
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,In Ubuntu you will have to install Java on your own that might the reason it didn't install for you @deathwalker007,1538590126
Yash,Anand,deathwalker007,msfvenom is not working properly it is generating d/f payload,1538590210
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Oh ok. Then BlackArch seems for you,1538590303
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Still I find it disturbing that kali isn't updating properly,1538590326
vader121,,vader_121,"Arch, Manjaro, mint, Ubuntu, elementary,",1538592225
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,Manjaro,1538592287
vader121,,vader_121,I was giving him options,1538592314
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,"Stable
Better customisation 
Nothing much to setup in manjaro plus gnome",1538592325
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,I am giving a suggestion,1538592333
vader121,,vader_121,Oohhh😅😅,1538592339
vader121,,vader_121,Gnome animation seems slow...,1538592358
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,"For this i liked hamara linux too
I am confused it's mate or xfce but yess a good gui with low consumption of graphics",1538592386
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,Use i3,1538592394
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Manjaro not as stable as Ubuntu. And also Antegros seems more stable at times.,1538592395
vader121,,vader_121,Cinnamon would be a great strting point,1538592400
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,Just 131 mb of ram usage,1538592404
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,Ubuntu is also not stable for me😅,1538592426
vader121,,vader_121,But wat if ure not good at cli and r jst strting up,1538592443
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,I dunno if they have personal grudges with me or not,1538592448
vader121,,vader_121,🙌,1538592450
vader121,,vader_121,😂😂,1538592455
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Which one?,1538592458
vader121,,vader_121,Me too,1538592458
vader121,,vader_121,Agree,1538592462
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,But whenever i install ubuntu it crashes in an hour or so,1538592469
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,It was 1 month of ubuntu usage,1538592492
vader121,,vader_121,The only distro till now after waiting for so long tht supports my system fully is Manjaro,1538592498
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,I installed it 5 timez,1538592500
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"I have never been able to crash vanilla Ubuntu like ever and I have crashed everything else.

And till date I have used Ubuntu the longest.",1538592507
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,Then i thought it is not for me,1538592516
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,"Vanilla ubuntu
Just run 
Apt update
Apt upgrade",1538592562
vader121,,vader_121,Mhwd is a really good idea put frwd by thm,1538592571
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,This will crash your ubuntu,1538592572
vader121,,vader_121,😂,1538592576
vader121,,vader_121,🤣,1538592582
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Nope not for me.,1538592598
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,You run them in proper way,1538592630
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,Just do update first then upgrade,1538592641
vader121,,vader_121,,1538592677
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Well I like to fiddle a lot but while i used Ubuntu I didn't have any other OS installed so I was probably very careful to not crash it.,1538592683
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,And I didn't even have another computer so I was in dire conditions,1538592716
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,"I too thought the same but once I did

rm -rf ~/hello.cpp",1538592753
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,-f bcoz it was encrypted,1538592777
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,And in ubuntu my home was deleted,1538592787
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,I always use -rvf with rm on my Manjaro,1538592811
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,Why -v,1538592821
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,I like to use it cause it tell me what's really happening,1538592911
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,-v = verbose,1538592920
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,I like knowing what I am doing,1538592939
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Only precaution I use is I don't use root,1538592956
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Rather sudo,1538592962
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,So I am safe until I forget which directory I am in.,1538592988
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Which happens at least once in a Blue moon.,1538593014
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,"and when i deleted my home 

i prefer to open file manager and delete that thing",1538593321
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,rather than using rm,1538593331
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,I still use terminal cause well it's soo easy and I am soo lazy.,1538594071
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,I am also lazy but can't take risk anymore,1538594399
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Don't use root and use aliasing to make sure rm is safer and you should be fine,1538594571
.,,rajudev,It should work. check your sources.list file located in /etc/apt,1538594589
.,,rajudev,also check your network connection,1538594599
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,The link it's showing is correct and he says that the net is fine.,1538594626
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,Is it necessary to add testing mirror,1538594631
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,To download certain packages like sudo,1538594647
.,,rajudev,I new this would be there in the messages ahead,1538594659
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,😂😂😂😂,1538594679
.,,rajudev,"sudo should be present in most repositories, no specific need of the testing suite",1538594696
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,I had to add,1538594716
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,I am still some what disturbed.,1538594722
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Which distro??,1538594732
Yash,Anand,deathwalker007,"Got it, there is some problem in  resolve.conf",1538594743
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,Deb 9,1538594746
.,,rajudev,you can check the repository status in the web browser or change from the list of repositories that kali provides in the sources.list file,1538594760
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"I personally am not a fan of these so called super stable distros.

I have crashed Debian more than I have crashed anything else.",1538594794
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,He said it was the problem with resolve.conf,1538594812
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,@deathwalker007 bro mind elaborating..,1538594831
.,,rajudev,good for you. Whatever rocks your boat.,1538594839
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,I don care about stability but yes Debian is somewhat i should have started using a long time ago,1538594840
Kuntal,M,hellozee,wrong verb then,1538594841
.,,rajudev,I read it later. I replied to a previous message,1538594865
.,,rajudev,Meri english ke liye maaf karein,1538594889
Dunken,Master,dunkenmaster,There is still more interesting  facts to explore in apt,1538594890
Kuntal,M,hellozee,how ironic,1538594900
Kuntal,M,hellozee,the word explore goes with portage not APT,1538594972
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,pacman is still soo much better than apt,1538595002
Kuntal,M,hellozee,both are same,1538595026
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,What's the irony?,1538595028
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,I seem to have confused apt with apt-get then,1538595055

Reason being that when the potential gradient is formed, the water would turn and become two smaller dipoles, and the positive end of one dipole would be very near the negative end of the other. And if they can come in contact, then that would mean that charge could flow thus the system going to a lower energy state and allowing the water bridge to form",1539015054

Scale is extremely small, type - hack

(Im not even serving html over http for now, just double clicking it)",1539055102

I tried (both http and file) to send ajax (jquery, fetch, axios, xmlhttpreq) it wouldn't let me send back int, and sent string as readablestream to browser

I remember it flask being easy to use (1.5yrs ago), but maybe I didn't invest enough time or they changed something",1539064026
Nikhil,Warke,nickdex,"It took me far less time and browsing to set it up (to create working proto) with node, so at this point Im just looking into possibilities for since python is better for scripting.

Atibhi,Agrawal,,"Hi everyone !

I am Atibhi Agrawal, a third-year undergraduate of IIIT Bangalore. I have known about linuxchix for a long time and have always wanted to start a chapter in Bangalore. But I did not know how to proceed. I met community members of linuxchix at Pycon India and they told me to join this telegram group. i will be grateful if you can guide me on how I can start a chapter in Bangalore :)


Also here is a little bit about me -


I am a Rails Girls Summer Of Code Scholar 2018. I am also a part of the ACM Chapter of IIIT B and often conduct sessions on getting women in tech and promoting diversity and inclusion.

I am one of the maintainers at Open Source Diversity Org Website (https://opensourcediversity.org/) where we list out resources for women. Do check it out! 
:)",1539163295

I think @shivanib and @CuriousLearner would be able to help you out here",1539163557

Atibhi,Agrawal,,Thank you @cocoa1231,1539163588
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,"Welcome, Atibhi!
In order to start a chapter in Bangalore, all you have to do is find some talks (write here if you need help selecting the topics) and a venue and a few interested people.
Decide on a date and let us know we shall promote on social media so that people in Bangalore get to know about it.

Please note that we still need to make a decision whether different chapters should have different social media channels. @utkarsh2102 @cocoa1231 @sakshi04 thoughts?",1539163734
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,We also need to make an active chapters section on our website,1539163756
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Wait, are we the only active Indian chapter? 🙈",1539163850
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"I think different social media channels is the way to go, because that way people can subscribe to their local community. Otherwise people who just want the local news will get spammed by other chapter's news.",1539163893

Atibhi,Agrawal,,"Okay so a few questions regarding the Bangalore chapter.
1. Do I need to register the LinixChix Blr somewhere officially ?
2. What about various social media accounts ? Do I manage them personally or accounts are given by LinixChix.
3. I want to recruit a few more core members. Can I roll out a Google Form for various positions ?",1539172693
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"1. @shivanib knows, I think you have to contact linuxchix.org to get a subdomain? But for that, this community will just move our current page to india.linuxchix.org/delhi and add a bangalore page or something like that
2. Volenteers form the community manage social media accounts. I don't think they're given by LinuxChix, you can just make one. Like LCI Delhi has twitter.com/linuxchixin
3. In this community we just encourage people to join the group and start contributing. There is no hirarchy per-se. You can give it a shot if you feel like that'd be better. Rest @shivanib be can explain better I think",1539173066

cocoa,,cocoa1231,IRC is cool,1539173183
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Oh, my thoughts:
1. Don't proceed alone. Get a small team of like-minded people. Managing the community all by yourself will not be possible, tbh.

2. Before starting on your own, help us here with all types of volunteering task, so as to have a better idea.

I don’t think it’s geo specific to country. It can be anything unless one/team is willing to execute.

NCR Delhi you should have opted something similar delhi-ncr.linuxchix.org or.. similar. 

She still can acquire  bangalore.linixchix.org or blr.linuxchix.org, so on!

Something only!
https://github.org/Microsoft:
😋",1539190174

Aakash,Saini,,,1539202070
Aakash,Saini,,Check out!,1539202079
Aakash,Saini,,Without APIs,1539202099
Aakash,Saini,,Just the bash script!,1539202113
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Technically you do use the HTTP API,1539202137
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,You see that curl line there that's the API file,1539202137
cocoa,,cocoa1231,:P,1539202141
Aakash,Saini,,Yes! GET.,1539202149
Aakash,Saini,,😋,1539202154
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,It's not possible without the API usage at least to some extent,1539202188
cocoa,,cocoa1231,You can do the same thing with Python using urllib3. Code would be more readable too. Just the reason why I was prefering python,1539202189
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Mine was python,1539202207
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yeah, ik",1539202214
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Although I do like the bash solution,1539202220
cocoa,,cocoa1231,It's interesting to do this with bash,1539202227
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Bash is gold but a little harder to do.,1539202238
Aakash,Saini,,API means application program interface. GitHub API themselves uses the http prototype GET/Pull,1539202242
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yeah,1539202243
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Well, at this point we'd go down the rabbit hole of discussing what an API is :P",1539202267
Aakash,Saini,,😋,1539202289
cocoa,,cocoa1231,One thing that I would absolutely love to see is web scraping with pageiniation using pure bash,1539202290

Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"I especially hate the fact that, in bash this raises an error.

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Eh. It's old. Use fish if you wanna :P,1539202340
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Cause I use vim so I never get this linted or formatted,1539202340
Aakash,Saini,,I got what I was lookin for!!,1539202349
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Fish seemingly has the same prob from what I remember.,1539202360
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Not sure about that specfic problem,1539202372
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Let me confirm give me a sec.,1539202392
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But a better solution would be to just bodge in a rule for that specific problem in vimscript,1539202393
Aakash,Saini,,This basics help me keep track of changes to GitHub space and new projects additions.,1539202413
Aakash,Saini,,Further I prefer mirror than clones!,1539202446
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Well I setup my vim to do auto git fetch in the folder I am using it in.,1539202474
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,Cause this way I know if I have anything to pull,1539202486
Aakash,Saini,,Never mix coffee & tea😋,1539202507
cocoa,,cocoa1231,xD,1539202517
Swarnim,Arun,Minraws,"I don't drink tea so I think I am safe, although Black tea is a different matter.
Black tea + Black Coffee = ☠",1539202703

Sanya,Swain,sanyaswain,The router.json file has some information about the redirects and the paths. And I don't really see it being used anywhere in the .html code,1539534882
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,What framework are you using? I'm not sure what uses json file to read paths. But if it's paths then the router file shall have the path to HTML file,1539535909

Nikhil,Warke,nickdex,"Idk about other framework's routers, router.js have references of component (fancy way of packaging html, js and css into one file, in name of reusable component).
and this router is different from backend router (like express's). its used for SPA navigation",1539572754
Nikhil,Warke,nickdex,"so unlike backend router which resolves and serves html page (or resource), frontend router makes requests to server. When it doesn't get a html for a router from backend, we get broken link",1539572880

Nikhil,Warke,nickdex,"There are 4 json in total in project, and many js file. we use json for data/config (static) and js for logic that executes (dynamic). Vscode tip - <ctrl-p> to open a dropdown of all project files and a textfield for searching via name or extension",1539577279
VogonPoet,,vogonpoet,Ctrl P is a chrome thing. It'll work in any electron project,1539577509
Nikhil,Warke,nickdex,"(source code) file extensions are have to do with language. Router is a pattern. think of it like a pan wala bhaiya. Whenver you need to find a house somewhere you ask it, it tell how to go",1539577639

Nikhil,Warke,nickdex,chrome thing or electron thing? on browser it opens print dialog,1539577700
Nikhil,Warke,nickdex,"to differentiate between them, well one simple way is to see its location. if its alongside other server/frontend file. other is to find who is using it (following the import trail)
In this case its easy as this project has only frontend files",1539577841

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Alright. Well I've installed java one way or another. Might just periodically pull and check out this app ;),1539622459
Donald,Trump,dee2dee,@hellozee should recall how much faith I put in it and how it eventually didn't screw up (it almost did) 😜,1539622479
Donald,Trump,dee2dee,"Ah, sure! Although it aims to do something highly specific. Like running Quiz shows. Replacing powerpoint presentations. Not sure if you'll ever find it useful 😂",1539622566
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Haha. cowsay ain't useful, but it's fin ;)",1539622604
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"And given me, I'll find some use for it",1539622619
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,Woohoo,1539625268
Kuntal,M,hellozee,hardware did though,1539627067
Donald,Trump,dee2dee,The sad story we tried to avoid.,1539627133
Donald,Trump,dee2dee,Remember there was a lag in the other non windows non ssd laptops?,1539627157
Kuntal,M,hellozee,javaaaaaa,1539627212
Donald,Trump,dee2dee,GC was probably failing to do its job.,1539627230
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"GC cannot be always blamed, sometimes it is our fault too",1539627491
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,"So I was just looking up MBR and GPT again. When terms at some places really are confusing, turns out Alok was right. It's the size of the hard disk that matters. (2TB for MBR)  
It is also unrelated to the 16 b/B thingy (this is also different at different resources)

@cocoa1231 @utkarsh2102 fact correction",1539627839
Donald,Trump,dee2dee,Ah no. I checked. I usually never blame the gc. The GC has some issues with javafx media object.,1539627926
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,And everyone who attended the Meetup actually.,1539628266
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Oh! I always thought that it was per  partition
Nice",1539628321
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,"I read partition like in 2 articles, some others including archwiki said it's HDD",1539628401
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Huh,1539628416
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,Now I'm not quite sure what is meant by 16/64 b/B,1539628475
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table#History
Yeah, seems like it's disk size",1539628530
cocoa,,cocoa1231,In what context?,1539628533
cocoa,,cocoa1231,like 16 bit/64 byte?,1539628548
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Maybe that's the sector size that each partition table allows?,1539628559
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I didn't understand what b/B is,1539628582
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,So some places have written Bytes and some have written bits. Now there is so much of difference and I don't know what do they mean,1539628870
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,Umm. Remember I talked that the partition size is calculated with this number? 2^16 bla bla It probably isn't. Or maybe it is. I'm not at all sure about anything now.,1539628939
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,These things require a lot of fact checking,1539628970
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"*sigh*
yeah. I think the Arch wiki and wikipedia are the most credible sources for this?",1539629014
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"If multiple sources disagree, we pick the most credible",1539629025
Shivani,Bhardwaj,shivanib,I trusted archwiki for HDD thingy,1539629034
Kuntal,M,hellozee,The reason why Qt is more suited for this kind of applications,1539629439
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,"2tb is for hard drives with 2^32 sectors which, when using 512Bit sectors",1539629683
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,"wiki - ""The organization of the partition table in the MBR limits the maximum addressable storage space of a disk to 2 TiB (232 × 512 bytes).[2] Approaches to slightly raise this limit assuming 33-bit arithmetics or 4096-byte sectors are not officially supported, as they fatally break compatibility with existing boot loaders and most MBR-compliant operating systems and system tools, and can cause serious data corruption when used outside of narrowly controlled system environments.""",1539629729
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,"* 
 2^32*512",1539629770
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,"in simple words mbr is in first sector 
if the sector size if 512 bytes then there's that hard drive size limitation",1539629917
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,and this is for the classical generic MBR,1539630022
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,this gets more and more confusing while i'm diving deep 😂,1539630046
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,things are really confusing so take it with a grain of salt ‼,1539630162

Premraj,Thakur,,?,1539686658
VogonPoet,,vogonpoet,No,1539686667
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"It does not whatsoever. Just make sure you're not installing a 64 bit OS on a 32 bit CPU :P
Did that when I installed it for the first time, and that thing never booted up",1539686686
cocoa,,cocoa1231,But that's not Linux-specfic. Install 64 bit windows on a blank 32 bit CPU and that will fry your computer too,1539686715
Premraj,Thakur,,I am planning to install gentoo linux into my system which is already having windows,1539686769
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Have you installed any linux distro before this?,1539686782
Premraj,Thakur,,No,1539686787
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Gentoo might not be the best idea for your first distro. It requires a lot of compilation and manual setting up,1539686809
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Go for linuxmint.com or something like that for your first distro,1539686820
VogonPoet,,vogonpoet,Good luck installing gentoo,1539686828
Premraj,Thakur,,"Ok so which one would you suggest , void ?",1539686831
cocoa,,cocoa1231,linuxmint.com for sure,1539686840

cocoa,,cocoa1231,Best first distro out there,1539686845

Premraj,Thakur,,I got to know that is also one distro..,1539686936

Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,@soumya08 her laptop got fried after Linux mint installation,1539686990
Premraj,Thakur,,Actually I value my laptop a lot that's why I was asking about risks,1539687031
cocoa,,cocoa1231,What happened exactly?,1539687065
Premraj,Thakur,,"On the theory side , I would like to know ..how is it decided that what amount of system memory would the linux os be able to control .",1539687091
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I've installed mint on a shit ton of devices. Never heard about hardware damage because of it. @Pradhvan has been using it since he started with linux,1539687095
cocoa,,cocoa1231,As in RAM or storage?,1539687106
cocoa,,cocoa1231,RAM is dedicated completely to whatever OS is running. Both won't run simultaniously,1539687118
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,Theoretically you can't fry your laptop just by installing softwares or messing around with your OS unless you know exactly what to do,1539687123
Premraj,Thakur,,Storage,1539687134
cocoa,,cocoa1231,You partition your disk to allocate storage to an OS,1539687149
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Lemme show you my setup,1539687153
cocoa,,cocoa1231,,1539687172
Premraj,Thakur,,Sure thanks,1539687177
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"So / is my current Linux distro, i.e Arch",1539687186
cocoa,,cocoa1231,And I've given that 70 GB,1539687191
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"And the partition next to it /dev/sda3 is my home partition, which cintains all my stuff that I download and use. This partition does not contain any system files",1539687229
cocoa,,cocoa1231,I've given that about 621 GB,1539687236
Premraj,Thakur,,What does partioning do internally ?,1539687248
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,"It was a very old laptop, not repasted in years 
After running for a few hours Mobo fried out completely",1539687255
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Partitioning is like marking off sections of the storage unit for a specfic purpose.,1539687294
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,Mint got heating issues,1539687301
Premraj,Thakur,,And you use some tool like fpart or something like that ?,1539687330
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yes, so you can use fpart, but it's much easier to just go with tools like gparted",1539687352
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Which is what the screenshot above shows,1539687358
Premraj,Thakur,,What do the codes for these tools do internally to achieve this ?,1539687391
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"On a hardware level, I am not sure. If I had to guess, I'd say that the kernel sends instructions to the hard disk/solid state drive to mark off areas, and then that is the hard disk's/SSD's job",1539687445
Pradhvan,Bisht,Pradhvan,I have used linux mint as my primary OS for 3 - 3 and half years nothing happend :),1539687479
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yup. It's rock solid.,1539687493
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"There are edge cases like @Alok760's case, I guess. But for the most part, it's pretty dang stable",1539687510
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Could be a bottleneck. Kernel trying to communicate with hardware without proper drivers, must take more CPU time, causing it to heat up",1539687542
cocoa,,cocoa1231,That'd be my guess,1539687552
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,It wasn't my laptop,1539687574
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,I worked on mint for more than 2 years,1539687588
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yeah, I figured. That beast'll handle anything :P",1539687591
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,Now I like KDE more,1539687608
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Too heavy for my taste,1539687620
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,@soumya08 it was her laptop,1539687653
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,Now she has a gaming laptop,1539687658
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Noyce,1539687667
Pradhvan,Bisht,Pradhvan,linux mint is the reason I still have cinnamon on my manjaro,1539687671
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Haha. Nice :P,1539687682
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,Is cinnamon available separately? 😂,1539687700
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Haha, yes it is ;)",1539687709
Pradhvan,Bisht,Pradhvan,yeah manjaro has a community editon,1539687717
cocoa,,cocoa1231,,1539687728
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,I used mate for my old potato laptop,1539687735
Pradhvan,Bisht,Pradhvan,but you could always install whatever desktop env you like,1539687735
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yeah, that's a nice lightweight desktop",1539687747
cocoa,,cocoa1231,yeah. I'm trying to not install every DE on this installation of arch. It eventually gets too cluttered up and it's a pain to reinstall sometimes,1539687783
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Especially with this laptop. rtl8723de drivers aren't in the kernel, so you gotta plug it into a Ethernet cable to install",1539687806
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,Too many DEs messes up my resolution scaling,1539687812
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yeah,1539687816
Pradhvan,Bisht,Pradhvan,hahaha the reason I installed the community edition rather than installing it myself and changing it.,1539687837
Pradhvan,Bisht,Pradhvan,It feels and behaves like it's native destop env,1539687840
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,"I use 27"" monitor at home, kde is so much multitasking friendly",1539687855

Pradhvan,Bisht,Pradhvan,I wrote a blog just so that I can refrence it later when I mess with the wifi,1539687922
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,I love intel WiFi cards,1539687946
Pradhvan,Bisht,Pradhvan,I so want to do that but I can't seem to convince myself :-P,1539687953
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,No driver problems,1539687953
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Haha, install both on your manjaro system, use i3 occationally. You'll get the hang of it",1539687993
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Yeah,1539687995
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Um,1539688013

Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,vala ftw,1539691635
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,Why the heck is everything shifting to gitlab,1539691655
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Mainly because gitlab is FOSS,1539691695
cocoa,,cocoa1231,And github is a corporate,1539691701
cocoa,,cocoa1231,And even professional companies deploy their own gitlab servers for private use,1539691716
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,isnt github?,1539691732
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Don't get me wrong, gitlab is definitely a corporate, but it's more FOSS oriented",1539691735
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Nope,1539691738
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Completely propriatory :P,1539691743
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,oh because of the private repo for pay thingy?,1539691751
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,got it,1539691760
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"No, it's not open source",1539691761
cocoa,,cocoa1231,It's source code is not online,1539691767
cocoa,,cocoa1231,You can't deploy your own github server,1539691773
cocoa,,cocoa1231,You can deploy your gitlab server,1539691779
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Because the source is online,1539691785
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,woah,1539691789
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Just build gitlab on any server,1539691791
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,thats cool,1539691794
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yea, pretty sweet",1539691796
cocoa,,cocoa1231,You can do it on a raspberry pi too :P,1539691811
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Keep it in your house,1539691820
cocoa,,cocoa1231,As your own private gitlab server,1539691824
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,why does that seem like a bad idea,1539691837
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"It seems like it, but lots of people do do it",1539691849
cocoa,,cocoa1231,And it works pretty well,1539691856
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,sick if it works for you.. personally I dislike gitlab's UI. but if it works for you go for it,1539691892
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Well that's just a matter of familiarity IMO
You're familiar with github so you prefer it more
Just like you were familiar with windows, so you prefered it more",1539691968
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Doesn't mean windows was better :P,1539691988
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,umm not exactly. there is a pretty great reason for my dislike,1539692000
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,lemme just take a screenshot,1539692011
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,alright  I broke firefox,1539692140
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,the reason was that  the text is unreadable,1539692154
cocoa,,cocoa1231,yup. checks out,1539692155
cocoa,,cocoa1231,It is?,1539692160

Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,alright I am back,1539692281
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,this is,1539692307
cocoa,,cocoa1231,And?,1539692307
cocoa,,cocoa1231,What's unreadable about this?,1539692316
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"I mean, pretty readble to me",1539692360
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,idk its just me (UI is realtive) and ..,1539692389
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,I cant preview READMEs,1539692396
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Huh?,1539692403
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Show me?,1539692406
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,markdown's in general,1539692413
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Not just on gitlab?,1539692421
cocoa,,cocoa1231,,1539692439
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,,1539692441
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Renders just fine,1539692442
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,nope while edtiting,1539692449
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,it renders fine,1539692462
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,just cant preview it while I am doing so..,1539692471
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Github doesn't view it too,1539692498
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,preview changes,1539692524
cocoa,,cocoa1231,You can preview on gitlab too,1539692539
cocoa,,cocoa1231,,1539692548
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Plus gitlab has a webIDE,1539692586
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,woah,1539692589
cocoa,,cocoa1231,So you can write and commit changes quickly there,1539692594
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,alright didnt notice that,1539692599
cocoa,,cocoa1231,,1539692616
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,yeah that is pretty cool. I checked it befor,1539692619
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Yeah. Eh, give it a shot. You might like it",1539692638
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,lastly The discover repos secction is a bit ugly,1539692655
Srihari,Unnikrishnan,arcsaber,"but as I said, if its good for you .. use it",1539692672

So after the recent incident, we've come up with a rule that is to be followed by every member, men and women, alike.
Before messaging someone privately (PMs or DMs), one needs to take permission from that particular person on the group itself.
This is a rule we follow at IRC and should be implemented here, as well. No one is allowed to text the other person without due permission.
If found doing so, the person would be initially warned and then removed from the group, next time.",1539754132

Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,I keep root 70 gb and home 200,1539792580
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Hi! Welcome to the community!
Firstly, nothing wrong with asking a ""noob question"" ;)
Secondly, I'd suggest you go for a larger root. I go for 50 to 60 gigs",1539792599
cocoa,,cocoa1231,And the rest for home,1539792607
Animesh,Verma,AniVerma17,I gave 100GB to root,1539792612
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Depends on how much stuff you intend to install,1539792615
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,My root is on ssd 😢 space limitations,1539792639
cocoa,,cocoa1231,:P,1539792653
Animesh,Verma,AniVerma17,Yeah coz I work with heavy IDEs,1539792669
Sanyam,,,I am planning the same. That's why I am conscious about the size...,1539792675
cocoa,,cocoa1231,1) What's the space you're willing to give to Linux?,1539792697
cocoa,,cocoa1231,2) What kind of stuff do you intend to install,1539792704
cocoa,,cocoa1231,And you can increase the size of the root partition later too. It's not set in stone. It's just a little bit of a pain to do it,1539792726
Sanyam,,,"Truthfully, I was planning to go distro-hopping later on..
So i was thinking of restricting it to 30/120 ...",1539792747
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Okay, well if you're distro-hopping, you're not gonna be installing anything heavy, I assume",1539792782
Sanyam,,,Dont know about that. Sorry😅,1539792796
cocoa,,cocoa1231,So 150GB to Linux. Go for 40 gigs? That's what I'd recommend,1539792807
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,30gigs is enough actually for newcomers and having root on ssd is heaven,1539792808
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Haha, no worries. None of this is set in stone",1539792836
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Conclusion: go for 35 gigs,1539792842

Priyanka,Chaudhuri,,"Hi,

My name is Priyanka. I am a technology lawyer.

We are starting an initiative called Women in Tech, (“WIT”) – founded by Ms. Mishi Choudhary (technology lawyer and a digital rights activist), focused on working towards bridging the gender gap in the technology industry in India. Our vision is to ensure equal participation of women by providing them meaningful opportunities of employment in the tech space. 

The IT sector in India is one of the most important sources of employment for young Indians, however women account for only 34% of the total jobs in the industry. Considering the sector is a major employer in India, it should be the front runner in gender inclusiveness and promoting diversity in the workforce. Tothrottle the inclusion of young women in the IT sector, we have launched this initiative.
We want to interview prominent women who have been working in the tech space and put out their stories on our website. It’ll be a basic questionnaire with five questions. Let me know if you all can connect me with such women.
We are also planning informal meet-ups in our office in Delhi to discuss challenges that women working in the tech space face. Will post details on that later.",1539860352

Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Because it fastens my work.
I don't need mouse now. Just the keyboard with all the keys functional is enough.",1539941706

Apurv,,ajyotirmay,Plasma can do that :),1539941738

i3wm idle 30 MiB
plasma idle 300 MiB",1539941793

.,,rajudev,yes,1540042399

.,,rajudev,here is the solution. The binary  to launch the indicator was not kdeconnectd in my case. It was actualy /usr/bin/kdeconnect-indicator,1540043034
.,,rajudev,that got the icon in my case in the bar,1540043050

chargE,,charge1506,wsl :D,1540155189
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,Do it via xrandr.,1540155192
cocoa,,cocoa1231,So you've switched from arandr to xrandr?,1540155207
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,I use it both.,1540155234
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Because I still need to look  up the man page or stackoverflow for the exact command.
arandr get's the work done, easily.",1540155275
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,"Genuine question: 
What are the advantages of arch over other distributions",1540155397
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,"Last time I used it was just for the sake of my friends at college.
First thing is - everything is manual 
But are there any real advantages",1540155498
chargE,,charge1506,xrandr doesn't display any connected monitors,1540155529
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"There aren't ""advantages"", per se. Arch is a distribution made by a community who want more control over how their system is set up. With arch you get to pick every package you install, configure it exactly how you want. You have more control over your system than you'd  have with most other distributions. 

It's not a practical distribution. It requires maintanence and doesn't have real world applications. The whole point of arch is to have a distro by and for the community entirely. It's philosophy is to keep it simple, stuipid. And to me it's a nice balance between the time and resource consuming Gentoo and the out-of-the-box experience of Linux Mint (which isn't to say that both of them aren't fantastic distributions)",1540155607
cocoa,,cocoa1231,"Most people install it to learn about the system, not because there is any particular advantage",1540155639
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Other than maybe that it gets all the latest packages,1540155647
chargE,,charge1506,Neither xrandr or optirun xrandr shows any connected displays,1540155666
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Something wrong with the port maybe?,1540155714
cocoa,,cocoa1231,Can you try with another OS?,1540155720
chargE,,charge1506,"Nope, works fine in windows",1540155722
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Wait, what?
Just referesh?
Or plug in the cable again?",1540155726
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,How about arndr?,1540155766
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Technically, it shouldn't.
But..",1540155778
chargE,,charge1506,"What i have read on the forums,docs, internet i have to change the xorg config or bumblebee config, i tried some different ones, but it didnt work",1540155782
chargE,,charge1506,"arandr shows the same info, just my laptops display",1540155811
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,Thanks buddy 💯,1540155823
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,That is super weird.,1540155847
cocoa,,cocoa1231,:),1540155863
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"No idea about bumblebee.
But wait, wtf?",1540155884
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,Open up xserver-> prime profile and stop Nvidia and plug the cable in,1540155892
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,In some laptops hdmi is directly connected to nvidia,1540155945
chargE,,charge1506,Yep,1540155953
chargE,,charge1506,Thats the problem,1540155958
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,And optimus doesn't work if a monitor connected,1540155964
chargE,,charge1506,So you have to disable bumblebee and switch to nvidia on all the time,1540155981
chargE,,charge1506,That's what the internet says,1540155987
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,Yeup,1540155995
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,That's what I do,1540155999
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,"And bumblebee is just unmaintained 
It's so buggy with the 10 series cards",1540156024
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,"Everything is buggy with 9 series or above 
Idk why open source people are sleeping",1540156048
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"Kill intel-virtual-output after running, start it in a console with the -f switch.",1540156055
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,"This thing doesn't work, either?",1540156065
chargE,,charge1506,I've been getting great battery life and a very cool system with bumblebee enabled though,1540156081
chargE,,charge1506,Will not work as the HDMI output is connected to my GPU,1540156100
Pikachu,,pikaapikaaa,,1540156131
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,"My laptop is always connected to monitor and power so I use Nvidia all the time 
Except for the time I have to go out then I enable integrated gpu only",1540156174
chargE,,charge1506,Are you using bumblebee?,1540156186
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,"Nope, i used it, but it crashes xserver frequently so i just stopped",1540156227
chargE,,charge1506,So you switch gpu's using prime-select?,1540156250
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,Yeup,1540156260
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,There's a GUI as well,1540156298
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,But my hdmi is not directly connected to nvidia so im good,1540156319
chargE,,charge1506,"Can you guide me through how i could extend my monitor, i've been stuck with not being able to use my monitor on linux for a long time",1540156329
cocoa,,cocoa1231,New goal for next month: get amd to run as well as windows on linux,1540156340
chargE,,charge1506,Aren't the latest vega drivers really good?,1540156358
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,It's basically plug and play on kubuntu,1540156374
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,Are you using nvidia-390 ?,1540156427

.,,rajudev,I have not accessed phone files using kdeconnect recently.,1540184315
.,,rajudev,I use Thunar or Nautilus usually,1540184342
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,Thumari?😅,1540184359
.,,rajudev,Or dired in Emacs,1540184369
.,,rajudev,Lame Autocorrects,1540184385
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,That's an OS,1540184389
.,,rajudev,Well it is kind of,1540184401
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,I want something native on Linux 😂,1540184425
.,,rajudev,To browse files of system or of phone?,1540184455
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,Of phones. System fines are easily browsable using either thunar or ranger,1540184726
.,,rajudev,Your best bets as I already told are Nautilus or Dolphin,1540184774
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,,1540184823
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,I'll try Nautilus once,1540184937
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,Try dolphin,1540184959
.,,rajudev,Try thrice. It's good.,1540184965
.,,rajudev,Also dolphin is great as well,1540184976
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,"Already using it on Manjaro KDE, but on Ubuntu i3 setup, I'll need to install half of Plasma to use Dolphin :(",1540185024
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,Yeah,1540185030
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,Except it's not as feature rich as Dolphin,1540185046
.,,rajudev,Try installing via nix,1540185047
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,What's nix? Nix OS?,1540185057
.,,rajudev,The package manager of nixOS,1540185074
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,Install 100% plasma kde,1540185078
.,,rajudev,Nope,1540185087
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,Can that really be used on Ubuntu? Won't it break my system?,1540185096
.,,rajudev,I use it on Debian,1540185111
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,"I am on 100% Plasma primarily, but I want a lean i3 setup",1540185117
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,I'll give it a try :D,1540185128

Apurv,,ajyotirmay,Are you using Baloo?,1540185211
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,No,1540185257
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,This baloo ?,1540185266
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,"@hellozee on your blog you mentioned that PHP wasn't intended for handling website backends. Is that really true? If yes, what language will you mention if asked for website backends that's better/good enough as PHP?",1540185321
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,"No, not this one. Baloo file indexer. That's something I always disable when using Plasma. It eats a lot of memory while indexing",1540185355
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,Well maybe then it's on,1540185393
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,😂,1540185406
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,"Maybe, because otherwise Plasma is really subtle and nice",1540185442
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,That's why 90percent websites use PHP,1540185460
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,"I use it on my crappy hardware, and that's the only reason I'm using a DE like Plasma, because it is so modular that I can literally control which features I want or I don't",1540185487
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,To be fair cinnamon is quite good as well,1540185526
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,"Yeah, like PHP has matured a lot and it has a lot of tools to work with it, and I wanted to know if Golang has the same support or not",1540185529
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,Plasma is slow,1540185537
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,Doesn't work for me. Really heavy and slow for my system,1540185547
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,Golang got built in concurrency that's why people use it,1540185556
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,Please explain it in simple language 😅,1540185582
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,Go is just better than PHP for backend,1540185774
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,"You can do anything with it 
From making the page dynamic to low level servers 
PHP had one job
To sit with Apache and make the web page dynamic 
With PHP you'll hit limitations soon enough",1540185853
.,,rajudev,not as good as KDE,1540185868
Kuntal,M,hellozee,yup it was just a template engine for c,1540185892
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,Agree,1540185901
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,"I see. So it's better to go with Go? Because I want to start with backend development, but I haven't been able to figure out whether go with NodeJS or PHP, and now it seems like Go is a better choice for this purpose. I don't want a Swiss army knife, I just want a knife that does what it's meant to do. I want a really specific tool in my toolkit :)",1540185985
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,I see,1540185997
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,@hellozee this,1540186005
Kuntal,M,hellozee,I don't know,1540186078
Kuntal,M,hellozee,whichever you are comfortable with,1540186085
Kuntal,M,hellozee,all are nice languages,1540186096
Kuntal,M,hellozee,in their own way,1540186109
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,Okay,1540186165
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,"True
No language has just one component
Java is inherently slow because  of its bytecode running on jvm nature.
But in android it doesn't even matter as android uses ahead of time compilation, so when you open apps on your phone it actually runs the compiled machine code not the byte code",1540186450
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,Similarly Facebook was using PHP and it was slow so they made their own compiler for PHP,1540186484
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,Hence at the end of the day just using PHP for its Syntax,1540186502
Kuntal,M,hellozee,Nope Java is shit because of oracle,1540186511
.,,rajudev,. @hellozee,1540186542
Animesh,Verma,AniVerma17,Well now they use a self-made rip-off of PHP: Hack.,1540186572
Kuntal,M,hellozee,I need that spiderman meme right now,1540186575
.,,rajudev,Y U do this?,1540186593
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,"That's the reason I avoided using Java for a time, but for Android it has been good. However, I'm prefering Kotlin over Java for Android",1540186841
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,LOL,1540186844
Apurv,,ajyotirmay,Will keep that in mind,1540187147
Aakash,Saini,,"Still today middle-ware in world are written in Java.
If you have exploited Java at professional level, then only you will know potential of Java, else you only think jvm is problematic😋",1540188530
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"I dont have any problem with JVM but with the ""Professional"" thing, frigging backwards compatibility and why the heck it doesn't have type inference, still",1540188649
Ashutosh singh,Tomar,Pronoob66,"No one said java is bad.
I was merely giving example of how changing components result in a performance delta 🤯",1540188689
Aakash,Saini,,"What do you want to say by backward compatibility wrt Java? 
Can you state with example?
Old codes does run on newer jvm, but newer codes have backward compat issues! It’s because of newer sets of Libs & constructs.",1540189183
Aakash,Saini,,What is type inference?,1540189196
Kuntal,M,hellozee,"you don't have to explicitly write the type like in Go
we have something := func() if func returns int something is int
in c++ we have auto something = func()",1540189265
